    "content": "Positive results from the TROPION-Breast02 Phase III trial showedDatroway(datopotamab deruxtecan) demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement for the dual primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to investigator's choice of chemotherapy as 1st-line treatment for patients with locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) for whom immunotherapy was not an option. These late-breaking results will be presented today during a Proffered Paper session at the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress in Berlin, Germany (abstract #LBA21). Datrowaydemonstrated a 5.0-month improvement in median OS compared to chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.98; p=0.0291). Median OS was 23.7 months for patients treated withDatrowayversus 18.7 months for those treated with chemotherapy. Datrowayreduced the risk of disease progression or death by 43% compared to chemotherapy (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.47-0.69; p<0.0001) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Median PFS was 10.8 months for patients treated withDatrowayversus 5.6 months for those treated with chemotherapy. In addition to patients whose tumours did not express PD-L1, TROPION-Breast02 enrolled patients with PD-L1 expressing tumours for whom immunotherapy was not an option due to other factors. Rebecca Dent, MD, FRCP, Professor and Deputy Chief Executive Officer, National Cancer Centre Singapore, and principal investigator for the trial, said: “In TROPION-Breast02, datopotamab deruxtecan meaningfully extended patients’ lives and nearly doubled their time without disease progression. These are significant outcomes for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who are not suitable candidates for immunotherapy, and remarkable results considering the trial included a subset of patients with highly aggressive disease who are often excluded from research in this setting.” Susan Galbraith, Executive Vice President, Oncology Haematology R&D, AstraZeneca, said: “The TROPION-Breast02 results show for the first time that these triple-negative breast cancer patients may have an alternative to chemotherapy in the 1st-line setting that can both delay the progression of their disease and prolong their lives. ForDatrowayto have so significantly improved patient outcomes in the 1st-line metastatic setting as monotherapy also gives us great confidence in its potential in combination withImfinzi, and in the early-stage, potentially curative setting where our next studies are ongoing.” Ken Takeshita, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo, said: “Patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer have one of the worst prognoses of any breast cancer subtype, and for those who are not candidates for immunotherapy, chemotherapy has long been the 1st-line standard of care. The TROPION-Breast02 results showDatrowayhas the potential to replace traditional chemotherapy in this setting and to meaningfully improve survival of patients.” Datrowayis a specifically engineered TROP2-directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by Daiichi Sankyo and being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo.

Grade 3 or higher TRAEs occurred in 33% and 29% of patients in theDatrowayand chemotherapy arms, respectively. The most common Grade 3 or higher TRAEs were neutropenia (3%, 13%), stomatitis (8%, 0%), leukopenia (<1%, 4%), fatigue (3%, 3%), vomiting (1%, <1%), anaemia (2%, 3%), alopecia (0%, <1%), peripheral neuropathy (0%, 2%), dry eye (1%, 0%), nausea (<1%, <1%), decreased appetite (<1%, <1%) and constipation (<1%, 0%). There was one Grade 5 interstitial lung disease (ILD) event in theDatrowayarm adjudicated as drug-related by an independent committee. This event was characterised as Grade 3 pneumonitis and cause of death was attributed to disease progression by the treating investigator. AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo will also present updated results from the BEGONIA Phase Ib/II trial at ESMO showingDatrowayin combination withImfinzi(durvalumab) continued to demonstrate robust anti-tumour activity as 1st-line treatment for patients with metastatic TNBC across PD-L1 expression levels and specifically in those with high PD-L1-expressing tumours. These results will be presented on Monday, 20 October (abstract #555MO). AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo are evaluatingDatrowayacross stages and treatment settings of TNBC in three additional Phase III trials.TROPION-Breast03is evaluatingDatrowaywith or withoutImfinziin patients with Stage I-III TNBC with residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant systemic therapy.TROPION-Breast04is evaluating neoadjuvantDatrowayplusImfinziin patients with Stage II-III triple-negative or hormone receptor (HR)-low, HER2-low or -negative breast cancer.TROPION-Breast05is evaluating 1st-lineDatrowaywith or withoutImfinziin patients with metastatic TNBC whose tumours express PD-L1. Notes Triple-negative breast cancerTNBC accounts for approximately 15% of all breast cancer cases, with an estimated 345,000 diagnoses globally each year.1,2TNBC is diagnosed more frequently in younger and premenopausal women, and is more prevalent in Black and Hispanic women.3-5Metastatic TNBC is the most aggressive type of breast cancer and has one of the worst prognoses, with median OS of just 12 to 18 months and only about 14% of patients living five years following diagnosis.3,6,7 While some breast cancers may test positive for oestrogen receptors, progesterone receptors or overexpression of HER2, TNBC tests negative for all three.3Due to its aggressive nature and absence of common breast cancer receptors, TNBC is characteristically difficult to treat.3For patients with metastatic disease with PD-L1 expressing tumours, the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy has improved outcomes in the 1st-line setting.8,9However, for the approximately 70% of patients with metastatic TNBC who are not candidates for immunotherapy, chemotherapy remains the 1st-line standard of care.10,11 TROP2 is a protein broadly expressed in several solid tumours including TNBC.12TROP2 is associated with increased tumour progression and poor survival in patients with breast cancer.13,14 TROPION-Breast02TROPION-Breast02 is a global, multicentre, randomised, open-label Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy and safety ofDatrowayversus investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, capecitabine, carboplatin or eribulin) in patients with previously untreated locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC for whom immunotherapy was not an option. This included patients whose tumours did not express PD-L1 as well as patients with PD-L1 expressing tumours who could not receive immunotherapy due to prior exposure in early-stage disease, comorbidities or immunotherapy not being accessible in their geography. Enrolment included patients with de novo or recurrent disease, regardless of disease-free interval, and those with poor prognostic factors such as stable brain metastases. The dual primary endpoints of TROPION-Breast02 are PFS as assessed by BICR and OS. Key secondary endpoints include PFS as assessed by investigator, objective response rate, duration of response, disease control rate, pharmacokinetics and safety. TROPION-Breast02 enrolled 644 patients at sites in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. For more information, visitClinicalTrials.gov. DatrowayDatroway(datopotamab deruxtecan; datopotamab deruxtecan-dlnk in the US only) is a TROP2-directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology,Datrowayis one of six DXd ADCs in the oncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanced programmes in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.Datrowayis comprised of a humanised anti-TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, developed in collaboration with Sapporo Medical University, attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide-based cleavable linkers. Datrowayis approved in more than 35 countries/regions worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HR-positive, HER2-negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) breast cancer who have received prior endocrine-based therapy and chemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease based on results from theTROPION-Breast01trial. Datrowayis available in the US under accelerated approval for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastaticEGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received priorEGFR-directed therapy and platinum-based chemotherapy based on results from theTROPION-Lung05andTROPION-Lung01trials. Continued approval for this indication in the US may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.Datrowayis approved in Russia for the same population. Datrowayclinical development programmeA comprehensive global clinical development programme is underway with more than 20 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety ofDatrowayacross multiple cancers, including NSCLC, TNBC and urothelial cancer. The programme includes eight Phase III trials in lung cancer and five Phase III trials in breast cancer evaluatingDatrowayas a monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer treatments in various settings. Daiichi Sankyo collaborationAstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialiseEnhertuinMarch 2019andDatrowayinJuly 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply ofEnhertuandDatroway.

    "content": "Positive results from the DESTINY-Breast05 Phase III trial showedEnhertu(trastuzumab deruxtecan) demonstrated a highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) in patients with a high risk of disease recurrence. The trial comparedEnhertuwith trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) as a post-neoadjuvant treatment (after surgery) in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer with residual invasive disease in the breast and/or axillary lymph nodes after neoadjuvant treatment. Results showedEnhertusignificantly reduced the risk of invasive disease recurrence or death by 53% compared with T-DM1 as a post-neoadjuvant treatment (based on an IDFS hazard ratio [HR] of 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-0.66, p<0.0001). At three years, 92.4% of patients in theEnhertuarmwere alive and free of invasive disease, compared with 83.7% of those in the T-DM1 arm. The IDFS results were consistent across all prespecified subgroups. Enhertualso significantly reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death (disease-free survival [DFS]), a key secondary endpoint, by 53% (HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.34-0.66; p<0.0001).  Further,Enhertulowered the risk of distant disease recurrence (distant recurrence-free interval [DRFI]) by 51% and the risk of brain metastases (brain metastasis-free interval [BMFI]) by 36% versus T-DM1. Overall survival (OS) was not mature at the time of this planned interim analysis (2.9% maturity at data cut-off) and will be assessed in future analyses (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.34-1.10). Charles Geyer, MD, Chief Scientific Officer of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Foundation (NSABP) Foundation, Professor of Medicine at the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center and principal investigator for the trial, said: \"For patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant treatment, the post‑neoadjuvant setting represents a critical second opportunity to reduce recurrence risk, and in DESTINY‑Breast05Enhertureduced the risk of early recurrence or death by 53 per cent compared to the current standard of T‑DM1. These results, coupled with the safety data from the trial, are likely to transform clinical practice in the post-neoadjuvant setting for patients with high-risk disease, with the potential forEnhertuto set a new standard of care.\" Susan Galbraith, Executive Vice President, Oncology Haematology R&D, AstraZeneca, said: \"Progress in treating HER2-positive early breast cancer has been significant, yet managing patients at a higher-risk of recurrence remains challenging. These landmark data, alongside those from DESTINY-Breast11, underscore the potential ofEnhertuto become a foundational treatment in early-stage breast cancer, increasing the likelihood that more patients could be cured in this setting.” Ken Takeshita, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo, said: \"The results of DESTINY-Breast05 demonstrate a clear benefit ofEnhertuover the current standard of care in patients with high-risk HER2-positive early breast cancer following surgery, improving their chance for sustained long-term outcomes. These results, coupled with the results of DESTINY-Breast11, illustrate the continued promise ofEnhertuto move earlier in the breast cancer treatment paradigm where it can have the greatest impact on the lives of patients.\" Summary of Results: DESTINY-Breast05i Efficacy Measure Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; n=818) T-DM1(n=817) Efficacy Measure IDFSii Efficacy Measure 3-year IDFS rate, % Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; n=818) 92.4 T-DM1(n=817) 83.7 Efficacy Measure  Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; n=818) HR 0.47 (95% CI 0.34-0.66); p<0.0001 Efficacy Measure DFSiii Efficacy Measure 3-year DFS rate, % Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; n=818) 92.3 T-DM1(n=817) 83.5 Efficacy Measure  Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; n=818) HR 0.47 (95% CI 0.34-0.66); p<0.0001 Efficacy Measure DRFIiv Efficacy Measure 3-year event-free rate, % Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; n=818) 93.9 T-DM1(n=817) 86.1 Efficacy Measure  Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; n=818) HR 0.49 (95% CI 0.34-0.71) Efficacy Measure BMFIv Efficacy Measure 3-year event-free rate, % Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; n=818) 97.6 T-DM1(n=817) 95.8 Efficacy Measure  Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; n=818) HR 0.64 (95% CI 0.35-1.17) Efficacy Measure OSvi Efficacy Measure Survival at 3 years, % Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; n=818) 97.4 T-DM1(n=817) 95.7 Efficacy Measure  Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; n=818) HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.34-1.10) TDM-1, trastuzumab emtansine; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; IDFS, invasive disease-free survival; DFS, disease-free survival; DRFI, distant recurrence-free interval; BMFI, brain-metastasis-free interval; OS, overall survivaliData cut-off 2 July 2025iiIDFS is defined as the time from randomisation until the date of first occurrence of one of the following events: recurrence of ipsilateral invasive breast tumour, recurrence of ipsilateral locoregional invasive breast cancer, contralateral invasive breast cancer, a distant disease recurrence or death from any cause; based on investigator assessment; statistically evaluated using the pre-specified hierarchical testing procedureiiiDFS is defined as the time between randomisation and the date of the first occurrence of an IDFS event per STEEP criteria, including second primary non-breast cancer event, or contralateral or ipsilateral ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); based on investigator assessment; statistically evaluated using the pre-specified hierarchical testing procedureivDRFI is defined as the time between randomisation and the date of distant breast cancer recurrence; based on investigator assessmentvBMFI is defined as the time between randomisation and the date of documentation of brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease; based on investigator assessmentvi2.9% maturity The safety profile ofEnhertuobserved in DESTINY-Breast05 was consistent with its known profile with no new safety concerns identified. Grade 3 or higher treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) rates were comparable betweenEnhertuand T-DM1 (50.6% versus 51.9%). Rates of interstitial lung disease (ILD) were low in both arms with ILD events occurring in 9.6% of theEnhertuarm and 1.6% of the T-DM1 arm. The majority of ILD events were low Grade (Grade 1 or 2). There were no Grade 3 or higher ILD events for T-DMI. There were seven Grade 3 events and no Grade 4 events in theEnhertuarm. There were two Grade 5 events in theEnhertuarm as determined by an independent adjudication committee. The DESTINY-Breast05 results (abstract #LBA1) will be presented today during Presidential Symposium I alongside the results of the DESTINY-Breast11 Phase III trial (abstract #291O) at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2025 Congress in Berlin, Germany. DESTINY-Breast05 was conducted in collaboration with the NSABP, the German Breast Group (GBG), Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynäkologische Onkologie (AGO-B) and SOLTI Breast Cancer Research Group. Enhertuis a specifically engineered HER2-directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by Daiichi Sankyo and being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo. Notes Post neoadjuvant treatment for HER2-positive early breast cancerBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide.1More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022, with more than 665,000 deaths globally.1 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumours including breast cancer.2HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a result ofHER2gene amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in breast cancer.2Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2-positive.3 For patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer, achieving pCR with neoadjuvant treatment is the earliest indicator of improved long-term survival.4However, approximately half of patients who receive neoadjuvant treatment do not reach pCR and have poorer long-term outcomes, putting them at increased risk of disease recurrence.5-9 Post-neoadjuvant therapy represents a key opportunity to minimise the risk of recurrence and prevent progression to metastatic disease for patients with residual disease. Despite receiving additional treatment with T-DMI in the post-neoadjuvant setting, approximately 20% of patients still experience invasive disease or death and no reduction in the risk of CNS recurrence.10,11Once patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease, the five-year survival rate drops from nearly 90% to approximately 30%.12 New treatment options are needed in the early breast cancer setting to help reduce the likelihood of disease progression and improve long-term outcomes for more patients. DESTINY-Breast05DESTINY-Breast05 is a global, multicentre, randomised, open-label, Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy and safety ofEnhertu(5.4 mg/kg) versus T-DM1 in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer with residual invasive disease in breast and/or axillary lymph nodes following neoadjuvant therapy and a high risk of recurrence. High risk of recurrence was defined as presentation with inoperable cancer (prior to neoadjuvant therapy) or pathologically positive axillary lymph nodes following neoadjuvant therapy. The primary endpoint of DESTINY-Breast05 is investigator-assessed IDFS. IDFS is defined as the time from randomisation until first recurrence, distant recurrence or death from any cause. The key secondary endpoint is investigator-assessed disease-free survival. Other secondary endpoints include OS, distant recurrence-free interval, brain metastases-free interval and safety. DESTINY-Breast05 enrolled 1,635 patients in Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and South America. For more information about the trial, visitClinicalTrials.gov.

    "content": "Positive results from the DESTINY-Breast11 Phase III trial showedEnhertu(trastuzumab deruxtecan) followed by paclitaxel, trastuzumab and pertuzumab (THP) in the neoadjuvant setting (before surgery) demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate. The trial comparedEnhertufollowed by THP with dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by THP (ddAC-THP) in patients with high-risk, locally advanced HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer. Pathologic complete response is defined as no evidence of invasive cancer cells in the removed breast tissue and lymph nodes following treatment. In DESTINY-Breast11,Enhertufollowed by THP resulted in a pCR rate of 67.3% compared with 56.3% for ddAC-THP, representing a pCR rate improvement of 11.2%. Improvement in pCR rates was observed across both hormone receptor (HR)-positive and HR-negative subgroups (HR-positive: 61.4% versus 52.3%; HR-negative: 83.1% versus 67.1%). Additionally, after surgery, 81.3% of patients who received neoadjuvant treatment in theEnhertufollowed by THP arm had no or minimal residual invasive cancer (residual cancer burden [RCB] 0+I) detected in the resected breast or lymph node tissue compared to 69.1% of patients in the comparator arm. The secondary endpoint of event-free survival (EFS) was not mature at the time of this analysis (4.5% maturity at data cutoff); however, an early analysis showed a trend favouringEnhertufollowed by THP versus ddAC-THP (hazard ratio 0.56; 95% CI 0.26-1.17). Nadia Harbeck, MD, PhD, Director of Breast Center, Cancer Department of OB&GYN and CCC Munich, LMU University Hospital, Germany and principal investigator for the trial, said: “For patients with early breast cancer who are at high risk of disease recurrence, using the most effective treatment option at the earliest opportunity is critical to prevent recurrence, optimise safety and improve the potential for cure. In the DESTINY-Breast11 trial, more than two thirds of patients had a pathologic complete response with trastuzumab deruxtecanfollowed by THP, suggesting a potential new standard of care in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with high-risk, HER2-positive early breast cancer.” Susan Galbraith, Executive Vice President, Oncology Haematology R&D, AstraZeneca, said: “The goal of treatment in the early breast cancer setting is to provide patients with the best possible chance for cure whilst optimising the tolerability of the treatment regimen. The impressive pathologic response rates and favourable safety profile seen withEnhertufollowed by THP in DESTINY-Breast11 have the potential to transform treatment in the neoadjuvant setting and underscore the importance of bringingEnhertuinto earlier stages of HER2-positive disease.” Ken Takeshita, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo, said:“While achieving a pathologic complete response in HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer is critical for reducing disease recurrence and improving long-term prognosis, approximately half of patients still show evidence of residual disease following surgery with currently available neoadjuvant treatment options. The results from DESTINY-Breast11 show that treatment withEnhertufollowed by THP prior to surgery resulted in no evidence of residual invasive disease in two thirds of patients, illustrating the first treatment regimen in more than a decade to significantly improve outcomes in the earliest treatment setting for HER2-positive breast cancer.” Summary of Results: DESTINY-Breast11i,ii Efficacy Measure Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) ddAC (4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles)(n=320) Efficacy Measure pCR Efficacy Measure pCR rate, %iii Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) 67.3 ddAC (4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles)(n=320) 56.3 Efficacy Measure ΔpCR,% (95% CI)iii,iv Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) 11.2 (4.0-18.3) Efficacy Measure p=0.003 Efficacy Measure HR-positive subgroup pCR rate, %iii Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) 61.4 ddAC (4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles)(n=320) 52.3 Efficacy Measure ΔpCR, % (95% CI) Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) 9.1 (0.2-17.9) Efficacy Measure HR-negative subgroup pCR rate, %iii Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) 83.1 ddAC (4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles)(n=320) 67.1 Efficacy Measure ΔpCR, % (95% CI) Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) 16.1 (3.0-28.8) Efficacy Measure RCB (0+I)v Efficacy Measure RCB (0+I rate), % Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) 81.3 ddAC (4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles)(n=320) 69.1 Efficacy Measure ΔRCB, % Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) 12.2 Efficacy Measure RCB-I rate, % Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) 68.8 ddAC (4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles)(n=320) 57.5 Efficacy Measure RCB-0 rate, % Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) 12.5 ddAC (4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles)(n=320) 11.6 Efficacy Measure HR-positive subgroup RCB (0+I) rate, % Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) 78.0 ddAC (4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles)(n=320) 64.7 Efficacy Measure ΔRCB, % (95% CI) Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) 13.3 Efficacy Measure HR-positive RCB-I rate, % Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) 63.1 ddAC (4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles)(n=320) 52.8 Efficacy Measure HR-positive RCB-0 rate, % Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) 14.8 ddAC (4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles)(n=320) 11.9 Efficacy Measure HR-negative subgroup RCB (0+I) rate, %v Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) 90.4 ddAC (4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles)(n=320) 81.2 Efficacy Measure ΔpCR, % (95% CI) Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) 9.2 Efficacy Measure HR-negative RCB-I rate, % Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) 84.3 ddAC (4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles)(n=320) 70.6 Efficacy Measure HR-negative RCB-0 rate, % Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) 6.0 ddAC (4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles)(n=320) 10.6 Efficacy Measure EFSvi Efficacy Measure 2-year EFS, % Hazard ratio (95% CI) Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg; 4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles) (n=321) 96.9 ddAC (4 cycles) followed by THP (4 cycles)(n=320) 93.1 Efficacy Measure 0.56 (0.26, 1.17) THP, paclitaxel, trastuzumab and pertuzumab; ddAC, dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide; pCR, pathologic complete response; HR, hormone receptor; CI, confidence interval; RCB (0+I), residual cancer burden; EFS, event-free survival iData cut-off 12 March 2025; median duration of follow up was 24.2 months withEnhertufollowed by THP and 23.6 months with ddAC-THPiiBased on blinded central reviewiiipCR responders were defined as patients who only received randomised study treatment (at least one dose) and had pCRivStratified Miettinen & Nurminen method; p value crossed the 0.03 prespecified boundaryvRCB is based on raw data and is not corrected for non-starters, or any bridging/off study neoadjuvant treatment; therefore, there may be differences between pCR and RCB-0viEFS was 4.5% mature at interim analysis The safety profile ofEnhertufollowed by THP in DESTINY-Breast11 was consistent with the known profiles of each individual therapy with no new safety concerns identified. Enhertufollowed by THP showed a favourable safety profile compared with ddAC-THP with reduced rates of Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) (37.5% versus 55.8%), serious AEs (10.6% versus 20.2%), treatment interruptions (37.8% versus 54.5%) and left ventricular dysfunction (1.3% versus 6.1%). Rates of interstitial lung disease (ILD) were low and similar between arms with ILD events occurring in 4.4% of patients in theEnhertufollowed by THP arm compared with 5.1% in the ddAC-THP arm. The majority of ILD events were low Grade (Grade 1 and 2). There was one Grade 3/4 event in theEnhertufollowed by THP arm and five Grade 3/4 events in the ddAC-THP arm. There was one Grade 5 ILD event in each arm as determined by an independent adjudication committee. DESTINY-Breast11 results (abstract #291O) will be presented today during Presidential Symposium I, alongside the results from the DESTINY-Breast05 Phase III trial (abstract #LBA1) at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2025 Congress in Berlin, Germany. The DESTINY-Breast11 results will also be published in theAnnals of Oncologyin parallel with ESMO. A supplemental Biologics License Application forEnhertufollowed by THP based on the results from DESTINY-Breast11 is currently under review by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Enhertuis a specifically engineered HER2-directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by Daiichi Sankyo and being jointly developed and commercialised by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca. Notes HER2-positive early breast cancerBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide.1More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022, with more than 665,000 deaths globally.1 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumours, including breast cancer.2HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a result of HER2 gene amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in breast cancer.2Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2-positive.3 Approximately one in three patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer are considered high-risk, meaning they are more likely to experience disease recurrence and have a poor prognosis.4For patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer, achieving pCR with neoadjuvant treatment is the earliest indicator of improved long-term survival.5However, approximately half of patients who receive neoadjuvant treatment do not reach pCR.6-10 The current standard of care in the HER2-positive neoadjuvant setting in many regions of the world consists of combination chemotherapy regimens.11These regimens often include anthracyclines, which can be challenging for patients to tolerate and may result in long-term cardiotoxicity, reinforcing the need for new treatment options.11-13 DESTINY-Breast11DESTINY-Breast11 is a global, multicentre, randomised, open-label, Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvantEnhertu(5.4 mg/kg) monotherapy orEnhertufollowed by THP (paclitaxel, trastuzumab and pertuzumab) versus ddAC-THP in patients with high-risk (lymph node positive [N1-3] or primary tumour stage T3-4), locally advanced or inflammatory HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer. Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive either eight cycles ofEnhertumonotherapy; four cycles ofEnhertufollowed by four cycles of THP; or four cycles of ddAC followed by four cycles of THP. TheEnhertumonotherapy arm was closed early following a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The recommendation was based on multiple factors including a lower pCR rate, low likelihood thatEnhertualone would be superior to ddAC-THP, and timing of surgery. The recommendation was not related to safety. The primary endpoint of DESTINY-Breast11 is rate of pCR (absence of invasive disease in the breast and lymph nodes). Secondary endpoints include EFS, invasive disease-free survival, overall survival and safety. DESTINY-Breast11 enrolled 927 patients across multiple sites in Asia, Europe, North America and South America. For more information about the trial, visitClinicalTrials.gov. EnhertuEnhertuis a HER2 directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology,Enhertuis the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced programme in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.Enhertuconsists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide-based cleavable linkers. Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 85 countries/regions worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or in-situ hybridization (ISH)+) breast cancer who have received a prior anti-HER2-based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy based on the results from theDESTINY-Breast03trial. Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 85 countries/regions worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) breast cancer who have received a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from theDESTINY-Breast04trial. Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 45 countries/regions worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HR)-positive, HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) or HER2 ultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by a locally or regionally approved test, that have progressed on one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting based on the results from theDESTINY-Breast06trial. Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 60 countries/regions worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumours have activatingHER2(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results from theDESTINY-Lung02and/orDESTINY-Lung05trials. Continued approval in China and the US for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. Enhertu(6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 70 countries/regions worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab-based regimen based on the results from theDESTINY-Gastric01,DESTINY-Gastric02and/orDESTINY-Gastric06trials. Continued approval in China for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. Enhertu(5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 10 countries/regions worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC 3+) solid tumours who have received prior systemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options based on efficacy results from theDESTINY-PanTumor02,DESTINY-Lung01andDESTINY-CRC02trials. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. Enhertudevelopment programmeA comprehensive global clinical development programme is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety ofEnhertuas a monotherapy or in combination or sequentially with other cancer medicines across multiple HER2-targetable cancers. Daiichi Sankyo collaborationAstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialiseEnhertuinMarch 2019andDatroway(datopotamab deruxtecan) inJuly 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply ofEnhertuandDatroway. AstraZeneca in breast cancerDriven by a growing understanding of breast cancer biology, AstraZeneca is challenging, and redefining, the current clinical paradigm for how breast cancer is classified and treated to deliver even more effective treatments to patients in need – with the bold ambition to one day eliminate breast cancer as a cause of death. AstraZeneca has a comprehensive portfolio of approved and promising compounds in development that leverage different mechanisms of action to address the biologically diverse breast cancer tumour environment. WithEnhertu, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo are aiming to improve outcomes in previously treated HER2-positive, HER2-low and HER2-ultralow metastatic breast cancer, and are exploring its potential in earlier lines of treatment and in new breast cancer settings. In HR-positive breast cancer, AstraZeneca continues to improve outcomes with foundational medicinesFaslodex(fulvestrant) andZoladex(goserelin) and aims to reshape the HR-positive space with first-in-class AKT inhibitor,Truqap(capivasertib), the TROP2-directed ADC,Datroway(datopotamab deruxtecan), and next-generation oral SERD and potential new medicine camizestrant. PARP inhibitorLynparza(olaparib) is a targeted treatment option that has been studied in early and metastatic breast cancer patients with an inheritedBRCAmutation. AstraZeneca with MSD (Merck & Co., Inc. in the US and Canada) continue to researchLynparzain these settings. AstraZeneca is also exploring the potential of saruparib, a potent and selective inhibitor of PARP1, in combination with camizestrant inBRCA-mutated, HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. To bring much-needed treatment options to patients with triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive form of breast cancer, AstraZeneca is collaborating with Daiichi Sankyo to evaluate the potential ofDatrowayalone and in combination with immunotherapyImfinzi(durvalumab).

    "content": "The Powering Breast Cancer Progress (PBCP) grant programmeis an initiative funded by AstraZeneca and supported byCharities Aid Foundation (CAF)to improve health outcomes for underserved patient populations. The 2025 PBCP grant programme will continue to focus on patient navigation but will specifically focus on timely breast diagnosis and comprehensive breast cancer management. Full details on round two of the grant programme are set out in theGuidance for Applicants document. Eligible organisations can submit their grant application until 22 September 2025. Learn more about our PBCP grant programme below. The introduction of breast cancer screening, earlier diagnosis and innovative therapies, along with increased disease awareness have considerably improved the survival of people living with breast cancer.5-7However, significant barriers and inequities persist in breast cancer care, and the reduction in breast cancer mortality has not been shared equally among patient populations. Patients often experience differences in their diagnosis, treatment and care based on who they are and where they live, rather than their clinical needs.2-4 These inequities of care can lead to significant disparities in outcomes, for example: The PBCP grant programme, launched in 2024,is an initiative funded by AstraZeneca and supported by CAF. It has been established in recognition of the inequities in breast cancer care around the world and the significant barriers to optimal care that are contributing to avoidable breast cancer deaths. The programme aims to fund innovative and inspiring projects that could help transform breast cancer care for undeserved patient populations and patients living in areas of low socioeconomic status. Currently in its second year, the PBCP grant programme continues to focus on breast cancer patient navigation – an integral part of the patient experience as it helps individuals navigate their complex care pathway.7,8 Patient navigation has been identified as a critical evidence-based resource for patients with breast cancer as it has been suggested to improve patient outcomes, reduce the impact on healthcare systems and can help to reduce inequities in breast cancer care.3,8-12 However, there are significant barriers to accessing patient navigation services, and these are even more pronounced among underserved patient populations and patients living in areas of low socioeconomic status.7,8,13These barriers include a lack of recognition, inconsistent programme models and approaches and structural barriers, such as limited resources and investment.7In some countries, training and professionalisation of patient navigators is lacking, and, in most cases, there is no officially recognised oncology patient navigation certification, resulting in a lack of navigators, which is being reinforced by the shortage of nurses worldwide.8 The World Health Organisation (WHO) has recognised by patient navigation as an effective, evidence-informed intervention to support the framework of theWHO Global Breast Cancer Initiative (GBCI).11The GCBI framework offers valuable guidance to governments and health systems worldwide on ways to enhance their systems for detecting, diagnosing and treating breast cancer. The GBCI’s primary goal is to reduce cancer mortality through three key pillars: promoting health and early detection, ensuring timely diagnosis and providing comprehensive breast cancer management.11 The 2025 PBCP grant programme focuses on the GBCI’s second and third pillars – timely diagnosis and comprehensive breast cancer management. In 2024, its inaugural year, the PBCP grant programme received over 160 applications from 59 countries, with seven initiatives awarded a grant as follows: Prioritising Patient Navigation for Patients with Breast Cancer in El Salvador The grant will enhance the breast cancer patient navigation strategy in El Salvador by training health personnel via a standardised, continuous and evidence-based method to raise community awareness and provide practical assistance to patients, survivors, relatives and caregivers. Screening Help Initiative for Empowerment and Learning in Disadvantaged Women (S.H.I.E.L.D. Women)The grant will support a new programme to train volunteers as patient navigators, empowering them to guide and support disadvantaged patients throughout their breast cancer diagnosis and care journey, emphasising the importance of early detection and treatment. Women Empowering Women: Breast Cancer Navigation and Technology Programme (WEW-BCNAP)The grant will help train and empower 60 breast cancer survivors and retired nurses as patient navigators, utilising mobile technology to overcome barriers to care in hard-to-reach communities to ensure timely access to evidence-based breast cancer treatment. Establishing improved patient navigation services for patients with breast cancer across ArgentinaThe grant will enhance an existing patient navigator programme in Mendoza, Argentina to improve the early and ongoing management of breast cancer, and to serve as a proof of concept for expansion of similar programmes throughout Argentina. Enabling Culturally Sensitive Patient Navigation for Underserved Immigrant LatinasThe grant will support patient navigation services specifically tailored to the underserved immigrant Latina community, leveraging culturally sensitive language and practices to improve the patient experience and access to breast cancer care. Patient Navigation to Achieve Timely and Efficient Breast Cancer Care in an Under-Resourced SettingDemonstrating patient navigation as a critical investment to improve outcomes for individual patients and healthcare systems by comparing data between patients who received navigation support and those who did not, focusing on timely diagnosis, treatment adherence and completion of care. Increasing Access to Patient Navigation for Black Breast Cancer Patients Using Peer Support & NavigationThe grant will help enhance trusted and authentic peer support and navigation services for black breast cancer patients and their families, with a particular focus on those who are economically and socially marginalised. This critical intervention aims to promote equitable care and reduce disparities in outcomes. Veeva ID: Z4-73738Date of preparation: May 2025",

Data showed giredestrant in combination with everolimus significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death (progression-free survival; PFS) by 44% and 62% in the intention-to-treat (ITT) andESR1-mutated populations, respectively, compared with standard-of-care endocrine therapy plus everolimus.1The evERA study is evaluating the investigational giredestrant combination in people with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor and endocrine therapy.2This is the first positive head-to-head phase III trial investigating a selective oestrogen receptor degrader-containing regimen versus a standard-of-care combination.2The results are being presented in an oral session at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress 2025. Data will be shared with health authorities, with the aim of bringing this potential treatment option to people as soon as possible. “A particularly high unmet need remains for people who become resistant to endocrine therapies and CDK inhibitors. These study results support the potential for the giredestrant combination to become a new standard-of-care for all patients in this setting,” said Levi Garraway, MD, PhD, Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Resistance to standard-of-care therapies is common in the post-CDK inhibitor setting, and the results from evERA validate using a combination to address this challenge,” said Dr Erica L. Mayer, Medical Oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “The clinically meaningful benefit observed with the giredestrant and everolimus all-oral combination is impressive and speaks to its potential to improve outcomes for patients in need of new treatment options.” The giredestrant combination demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared with standard-of-care endocrine therapy plus everolimus.1In the ITT population, the median PFS was 8.77 months compared with 5.49 months in the giredestrant and comparator arms, respectively (stratified hazard ratio [HR]=0.56; 95% CI: 0.44-0.71, p-value= <0.0001).1In theESR1-mutated population, the median PFS was 9.99 months compared with 5.45 months in the giredestrant and comparator arms, respectively (HR=0.38; 95% CI: 0.27-0.54, p-value= <0.0001).1The PFS benefit was consistent across pre-specified subgroups in both populations.1Overall survival (OS) data were immature at the time of analysis, but a clear positive trend has been observed in the ITT (HR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.47-1.00, p-value=0.0473) andESR1-mutated populations (HR=0.62, 95% CI: 0.38-1.02, p-value=0.0566).1Follow-up for OS will continue to next analysis. Giredestrant in combination with everolimus also demonstrated improvements in key secondary endpoints (objective response rate and duration of response) compared with the comparator arm across both patient populations.1 Adverse events for the giredestrant-based combination were manageable and consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medicines.1No new safety signals were observed, including no photopsia.1 ER-positive breast cancer accounts for approximately 70% of breast cancer cases.3Resistance to endocrine therapies, particularly in the post-CDK inhibitor setting, increases the risk of disease progression and is associated with poor outcomes.3,4All-oral combination therapies, such as giredestrant plus everolimus, could address this by targeting two different signalling pathways while helping to minimise the impact of treatment on people’s lives without the need for injections.5,6 Our extensive giredestrant clinical development programme spans multiple treatment settings and lines of therapy, reflecting our commitment to deliver innovative medicines to as many people with ER-positive breast cancer as possible. About the evERA Breast Cancer studyevERA Breast Cancer [NCT05306340] is a phase III, randomised, open-label, multicentre study evaluating the efficacy and safety of giredestrant in combination with everolimus versus standard-of-care endocrine therapy in combination with everolimus in people with oestrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have had previous treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor and endocrine therapy, either in the adjuvant or locally advanced/metastatic setting.2 The co-primary endpoints are investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat andESR1-mutated populations, defined as the time from randomisation to the time when the disease progresses or a patient dies from any cause.2The trial has been enriched forESR1-mutated patients above the natural prevalence to assess the efficacy in this population. In the post-CDK inhibitor setting, up to 40% of people with ER-positive disease haveESR1mutations.7,8Key secondary endpoints include overall survival, objective response rate, duration of response, clinical benefit rate and safety.2 About giredestrantGiredestrant is an investigational, oral, next-generation selective oestrogen receptor degrader and full antagonist.9Giredestrant is designed to block oestrogen from binding to the oestrogen receptor, triggering its breakdown (known as degradation) and stopping or slowing down the growth of cancer cells.10 Giredestrant has an extensive clinical development programme and is being investigated in five company-sponsored phase III clinical trials that span multiple treatment settings and lines of therapy to benefit as many people as possible: About oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancerGlobally, the burden of breast cancer continues to grow, with 2.3 million women diagnosed and 670,000 dying from the disease every year.15Breast cancer remains the number one cause of cancer-related deaths amongst women, and the second most common cancer type.16 ER-positive breast cancer accounts for approximately 70% of breast cancer cases.3A defining feature of ER-positive breast cancer is that its tumour cells have receptors that attach to oestrogen, which can contribute to tumour growth.17 Despite treatment advances, ER-positive breast cancer remains particularly challenging to treat due to its biological complexity.5Patients often face the risk of disease progression, treatment side effects and resistance to endocrine therapy.5,18There is an urgent need for more effective treatments that can delay clinical progression and reduce the burden of treatment on people’s lives.5,18 About Roche in breast cancerRoche has been advancing breast cancer research for more than 30 years, and it continues to be a major focus of research and development.

These late -breaking results will be presented today during a proffered paper session  (LBA21 ) at the 2025 \nEuropean Society for Medical Oncology ( #ESMO 25) Congress.  \n \nDATROWAY is a specifically engineered TROP2 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by \nDaiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and being jointly developed and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo and \nAstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN).  \n \nDATROWAY  demonstrated a 5. 0 month  improvement in median OS compared to chemotherapy (hazard ratio \n[HR] =0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] : 0.64-0.98; p=0.0291). Median OS was 23.7 months for patients \ntreated with DATROWAY  versus 18. 7 months for those  treated with chemotherapy.  \n \nDATROWAY  reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 43% compared to chemotherapy (H R=0.57; \n95% CI : 0.47-0.69; p<0.0001) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Median PFS was 10.8 \nmonths for patients treated with DATROWAY  versus 5.6 months for those treated with chemotherapy.  \nDATROWAY was associated with more durable treatment responses  than chemotherapy . Confirmed objective \nresponse rate (ORR) was 62.5% with DATROWAY , including 29 complete responses (CR) and 173 partial \nresponses (PR) versus 29.3% with chemotherapy, including  eight  CRs and 86 PRs. Median duration of response\n2 \n (DoR) for patients treated with DATROWAY  exceeded one year (12. 3 months) versus 7. 1 months for those \ntreated with chemotherapy.  \n \nIn addition to patients whose tumors did not express PD -L1, TROPION -Breast02 enrolled patients with PD -L1 \nexpressing tumors for whom immunotherapy was not an option due to other factors. As of the August 25, 2025 \ndata cut -off, 45 patients  (14%) remained on DATROWAY  and eight patients ( 3%) on chemotherapy.    \n \n“In TROPION -Breast02 , datopotamab deruxtecan meaningfully  extended patients’ lives and nearly doubled \ntheir time without disease progression ,” said Rebecca Dent, MD , FRCP, Professor and Deputy Chief Executive \nOfficer, National Cancer Centre Singapore , and Principal Investigator for the trial . “These are significant  \noutcomes for patients with metastatic triple  negative breast cancer who are not suitable candidates for \nimmunotherapy , and remarkable  results  considering  the trial included a subset of patients with highly aggressive \ndisease who are often excluded from research in this setting.”   \n \nPatients receiving DATROWAY  were on treatment more than twice as long as those receiving chemotherapy \n(median duration of treatment of 8. 5 versus 4.1 months) and experienced a lower rate of treatment -related \nadverse events (TRAEs) associated with discontinuation (4% versus 7%). Grade 3 or higher TRAEs occurred in \n33% and 29% of patients in the DATROWAY and chemotherapy arms, respectively. The most common grade 3 \nor higher TRAEs were neutropenia (3%, 13%), stomatitis (8%, 0%), leukopenia (<1%, 4%), fatigue (3%, 3%), \nvomiting (1%, < 1%), anemia (2%, 3%), alopecia (0%, < 1%), peripheral neuropathy (0%, 2%), dry eye (1%, \n0%), nausea (<1%, <1%), decreased appetite (<1%, <1%) and constipation (<1%, 0%). There was one grade 5 \ninterstitial lung disease (ILD) event in the DATROWAY  arm adjudicated as drug -related by an independent \ncommittee. This event was characteri zed as grade 3 pneumonitis and cause of death was attributed to disease \nprogression by the treating investigator.  \n \n“Patients with metastatic triple  negative breast cancer have one of the worst prognos es of any breast cancer \nsubtype,  and for those who are not candidates for immunotherapy, chemotherapy has long been the first-line \nstandard of care,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “The TROPION -Breast02 \nresults show DATROWAY  has the potential to replace traditional chemotherapy in this setting and to \nmeaningfully improve survival  of patients.”  \n \n“The TROPION -Breast02 results show for the first time  that these triple negative breast cancer patients may \nhave a n alternative to chemotherapy in the first-line setting that can both delay the progression of their disease \nand prolong their lives ,” said  Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD,  Executive  Vice President, Oncology Hematology\n3 \n R&D, AstraZeneca . “For DATROWAY  to have so significantly improved patient outcomes in the first-line \nmetastatic setting as monotherapy also gives us great confidence in its potential in combination with  \ndurvalumab , and in the early -stage , potentially curative setting where our next studies are ongoing.”  \n \nSummary of TROPION -Breast02 Results  \n Efficacy Measure  DATROWAY  (n=323)  ICC (n=321)  \nMedian OS , months  (95% CI)  23.7 months  (19.8 -25.6)  18.7 months  (16.0 -21.8)   \n  HR (95% CI)  0.79 (0.64 -0.98)  \n  p-value  0.0291  \nMedian PFS by BICR , months  (95% CI)  10.8 months (8.6 -13.0)  5.6 months (5.0 -7.0) \n  HR (95% CI)  0.57 (0.47 -0.69)  \n  p-value  <0.0001  \nMedian PFS by investigator , months  (95% CI)  9.6 months (7.4 -11.2)  5.2 months (4.2 -5.6) \n  HR (95% CI)  0.56 (0.47 -0.67)  \nConfirmed ORR , %  62.5%  29.3%  \n  CR, n, (%) 29 (9 .0%) 8 (2.5%) \n  PR, n, (%)  173 (5 3.6%) 86 (2 6.8%) \nMedian DoR , months  (95% CI)  12.3 months (9.1-15.9)  7.1 months (5.6-8.9) \nBICR, blinded independent central review; CI, confidence interval; CR, complete response; D oR, duration of response; HR, hazard ratio; \nICC, investigator’s choice of chemotherapy; ORR, objective response rate; OS, overall survival; PFS, progression -free survival; PR, \npartial response  \n \nDaiichi Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  will also present updated results from the BEGONIA  phase 1b/2 trial at ESMO \nshowing DATROWAY  in combination with AstraZeneca’s anti -PD-L1 therapy durvalumab continued to \ndemonstrate robust anti-tumor activity as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic TNBC across PD -L1 \nexpression levels and specifically in those with high PD -L1-expressing tumors. These results will be presented \non Monday, October 20, 2025  (555MO ).  \n \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca are evaluating DATROWAY across stages and treatment settings of TNBC in \nthree additional phase 3 trials. TROPION -Breast03  is evaluating DATROWAY as adjuvant therapy with or \nwithout durvalumab versus investigator’s choice of therapy in patients with stage I -III TNBC with residual \ninvasive disease after neoadjuvant systemic therapy. TROPION -Breast04  is evaluating neoadjuvant \nDATROWAY plus durvalumab versus neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with stage II -\nIII triple negative or hormone receptor (HR) low, HER2 low or negative breast cancer. TROPION -Breast05  is \nevaluating first -line DATROWAY with or without durvalumab versus investigator’s choice of therapy in patients \nwith metastatic TNBC whose tumors express PD -L1.\n4 \n About TROPION -Breast02  \nTROPION -Breast02  is a global, multicenter, randomized, open -label phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and \nsafety of DATROWAY versus investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel, nab -paclitaxel, capecitabine, \ncarboplatin or eribulin) in patients with previously untr eated locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC for \nwhom immunotherapy was not an option.  This included patients whose tumors did not express PD -L1 as well as \npatients with PD -L1 expressing tumors who could not receive immunotherapy due to prior exposure in early -\nstage disease, comorbidities or immunotherapy not being accessible in their geogr aphy. Enrollment included \npatients with de novo or recurrent disease, regardless of disease -free interval, and those with poor prognostic \nfactors such as stable brain metastases.     \n   \nThe dual primary endpoints of TROPION -Breast02 are PFS as assessed by BICR  and OS. Key secondary \nendpoints include PFS as assessed by investigator, ORR , DoR , disease control rate  (DCR) , pharmacokinetics \nand safety.  \n \nTROPION -Breast02 enrolled 644 patients at sites in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. \nFor more information visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Triple Negative Breast Cancer  \nTNBC accounts for approximately 15% of all breast cancer cases, with an estimated 345,000 diagnoses globally \neach year.1,2 TNBC is diagnosed more frequently in younger and premenopausal women, and is more prevalent \nin Black and Hispanic women.3,4,5  Metastatic TNBC is the most aggressive type of breast cancer and has one of \nthe worst prognos es, with median OS of just 12 to 18 months and only about 14% of patients living five years \nfollowing diagnosis.3,6,7 \n \nWhile some breast cancers may test positive for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors or overexpression of \nHER2, TNBC tests negative for all three.3 Due to its aggressive nature and absence of common breast cancer \nreceptors, TNBC is characteristically difficult to treat.3 For patients with metastatic disease with PD -L1 \nexpressing tumors, the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy has improved outcomes in the first -line \nsetting.8,9 However, for approximately 70% of patients with metastatic TNBC who are not candidates for \nimmunotherapy, chemotherapy remains the first -line standard of care.10,11  \n \nTROP2 is a protein broadly expressed in several solid tumors, including TNBC.12 TROP2 is associated with \nincreased tumor progression and poor survival in patients with breast cancer.13,14\n5 \n About DATROWAY  \nDATROWAY (datopotamab deruxtecan; datopotamab deruxtecan -dlnk in the U.S. only) is a TROP2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, DATROWAY is one of six DXd \nADCs in the oncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanced programs in AstraZeneca’s \nADC scientific platform. DATROWAY is comprised of a humanized anti -TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, \ndeveloped in collaboration with Sapporo Medical University, attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor \npayloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cl eavable linkers.  \n \nDATROWAY (6 mg/kg) is approved in more than 35 countries/regions worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HR positive, HER2 negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast \ncancer who have received prior endocrine -based therapy and chemotherapy for unrese ctable or metastatic \ndisease based on the results from the  TROPION -Breast01  trial.  \n \nDATROWAY (6 mg/kg)  is approved in Russia and the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic EGFR -mutated non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received prior EGFR -\ndirected therapy and platinum -based chemotherapy, based on the results from TROPION -Lung05  and \nTROPION -Lung01  trials. Continued approval for this indication in the U.S. may be contingent upon verification \nand description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nAbout the DATROWAY Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway with more than 20 trials evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of DATROWAY across multiple cancers, including NSCLC, TNBC and urothelial cancer. \nThe program includes eight phase 3 trials in lung cancer and five phase 3 trials in breast cancer evaluating \nDATROWAY as a monotherapy and in combination with other cancer treatments in various settings.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU® in March 2019  and DATROWAY in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains \nexclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU \nand DATROWAY .   \n \nAbout the ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two  \ndistinct ADC technology platforms discovered in -house by Daiichi Sankyo.\n6 \n The ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC Technology where each  \nADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an  \nexatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently  \nconsists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and DATROWAY, a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being \njointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a HER3 \ndirected ADC, ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd), a B7 -H3 dire cted ADC, and raludotatug deruxtecan (R -DXd), a \nCDH6 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with Merck & Co., Inc, Rahway, \nNJ, USA. DS -3939, a TA -MUC1 directed ADC, is being developed by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe second Daiichi Sankyo ADC platform consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a modified  \npyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) payload. DS -9606, a CLDN6 directed PBD ADC, is the first of several  \nplanned ADCs in clinical development utilizing this platform.  \n \nIfinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan, raludotatug deruxtecan, DS -3939 and DS -9606 are \ninvestigational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy \nhave not been established.  \n \nDATROWAY U.S. Important Safety Information  \nIndications  \nDATROWAY® is a Trop -2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment \nof: \n• adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -mutated non -\nsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received prior EGFR -directed therapy and platinum -based \nchemotherapy.  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in the confirmatory trial.  \n \n• adult patients with unresectable or metastatic, hormone receptor (HR) -positive, human epidermal growth \nfactor receptor 2 (HER2) -negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received prior \nendocrine -based therapy and chemotherapy for unres ectable or metastatic disease.  \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis  \nDATROWAY can cause severe, life -threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis.\n7 \n Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC  \nIn the pooled safety population of 484 patients with NSCLC from TROPION -Lung01, TROPION -Lung05, and \nTROPION -PanTumor01, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 7% of patients treated with DATROWAY, including \n0.6% of patients with Grade 3 and 0.4% with Grade 4. There w ere 8 (1.7%) fatal cases. The median time to \nonset for ILD was 1.4 months (range: 0.2 months to 9 months). Eleven patients (2.3%) had DATROWAY \nwithheld and 20 patients (4.1%) permanently discontinued DATROWAY due to ILD/pneumonitis. Systemic \ncorticosteroid s were required in 79% (26/33) of patients with ILD/pneumonitis. ILD/pneumonitis resolved in \n45% of patients.  \n \nUnresectable or Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn the pooled safety population of 443 patients with breast cancer from TROPION -Breast01 and TROPION -\nPanTumor01, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 3.6% of patients treated with DATROWAY, including 0.7% of \npatients with Grade 3. There was one fatal case (0.2%). T he median time to onset for ILD was 2.8 months \n(range: 1.1 months to 10.8 months). Four patients (0.9%) had DATROWAY withheld and 7 patients (1.6%) \npermanently discontinued DATROWAY due to ILD/pneumonitis. Systemic corticosteroids were required in \n60% (9/1 5) of patients with ILD/pneumonitis.  ILD/pneumonitis resolved in 40% of patients.  \n \nPatients were excluded from clinical studies for a history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids \nor for ongoing ILD/pneumonitis.  \n \nMonitor patients for new or worsening respiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, \ncough, fever) during treatment with DATROWAY. For asymptomatic (Grade 1) ILD/pneumonitis, consider \ncorticosteroid treatment (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day predn isolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis \n(Grade 2 or greater), promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or \nequivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual taper for at least 4 wee ks. \n \nWithhold DATROWAY in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue \nDATROWAY if ≥Grade 2 ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed.  \n \nOcular Adverse Reactions  \nDATROWAY can cause ocular adverse reactions including dry eye, keratitis, blepharitis, meibomian gland \ndysfunction, increased lacrimation, conjunctivitis, and blurred vision.  \n \nIn the pooled safety population, ocular adverse reactions occurred in 36% of patients treated with \nDATROWAY. Twenty patients (2.2%) experienced Grade 3 ocular adverse reactions, which included keratitis, \ndry eye, and blurred vision, and one patient experie nced a Grade 4 ocular adverse reaction of conjunctival \nhemorrhage. The most common (≥5%) ocular adverse reactions were dry eye (17%), keratitis (14%), and \nincreased lacrimation (7%). The median time to onset for ocular adverse reactions was 2.3 months (ran ge: 0.03 \nmonths to 23.2 months). Of the patients who experienced ocular adverse reactions, 39% had complete \nresolution, and 10% had partial improvement (defined as a decrease in severity by one or more grades from the \nworst grade at last follow up). Ocular  adverse reactions led to dosage interruption in 3.6% of patients, dosage \nreductions in 2.5% of patients, and permanent discontinuation of DATROWAY in 1% of patients.  \n \nPatients with clinically significant corneal disease were excluded from clinical studies.  \n \nAdvise patients to use preservative -free lubricant eye drops several times daily for prophylaxis. Advise patients \nto avoid use of contact lenses unless directed by an eye care professional.\n8 \n Refer patients to an eye care professional for an ophthalmic exam including visual acuity testing, slit lamp \nexamination (with fluorescein staining), intraocular pressure, and fundoscopy at treatment initiation, annually \nwhile on treatment, at end of treat ment, and as clinically indicated.  \n \nPromptly refer patients to an eye care professional for any new or worsening ocular adverse reactions. Monitor \npatients for ocular adverse reactions during treatment with DATROWAY, and if diagnosis is confirmed, \nwithhold, reduce the dose, or permanently di scontinue DATROWAY based on severity.  \n \nStomatitis  \nDATROWAY can cause stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis.  \n \nIn the pooled safety population, stomatitis occurred in 63% of patients treated with DATROWAY, including 8% \nof patients with Grade 3 events and one patient with a Grade 4 reaction. The median time to first onset of \nstomatitis was 0.5 months (range: 0.03 mo nths to 18.6 months). Stomatitis led to dosage interruption in 6% of \npatients, dosage reductions in 11% of patients, and permanent discontinuation of DATROWAY in 0.5% of \npatients.  \n \nIn patients who received DATROWAY in TROPION -Breast01, 39% used a mouthwash containing \ncorticosteroid for management or prophylaxis of stomatitis/oral mucositis at any time during the treatment.  \n \nAdvise patients to use a steroid -containing mouthwash for prophylaxis and treatment of stomatitis. Instruct the \npatient to hold ice chips or ice water in the mouth throughout the infusion of DATROWAY.  \n \nMonitor patients for signs and symptoms of stomatitis. If stomatitis occurs, increase the frequency of \nmouthwash and administer other topical treatments as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of the adverse \nreaction, withhold, reduce the dose, or p ermanently discontinue DATROWAY.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nBased on its mechanism of action, DATROWAY can cause embryo -fetal harm when administered to a pregnant \nwoman because the topoisomerase inhibitor component of DATROWAY, DXd, is genotoxic and affects \nactively dividing cells.  \n \nAdvise patients of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective \ncontraception during treatment with DATROWAY and for 7 months after the last dose. Advise male patients \nwith female partners of reproductive  potential to use effective contraception during treatment with \nDATROWAY and for 4 months after the last dose.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nThe pooled safety population described in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to \nDATROWAY in 927 patients as a single agent at 6 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion once every 3 \nweeks (21 -day cycle) until disease progression or unacceptabl e toxicity. This included 137 patients with NSCLC \nin TROPION -Lung05, 297 patients with NSCLC in TROPION -Lung01, 360 patients with HR -positive, HER2 -\nnegative breast cancer in TROPION -Breast01, and 50 patients with NSCLC and 83 patients with breast cancer \nin TROPION -PanTumor01 (NCT03401385). Among 927 patients who received DATROWAY, 45% were \nexposed for 6 months or longer and 19% were exposed for greater than one year. In this pooled safety \npopulation, the most common (≥20%) adverse reactions were stomatitis (63%), nausea (52%), fatigue (45%), \nalopecia (38%), constipation (28%), decreased appetite (23%), rash (23%), vomiting (22%), and \nmusculoskeletal pain (20%). In this pooled safety population, the most common (≥2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory \nabnormalities were  decreased lymphocytes (9%) and decreased hemoglobin (3.5%).\n9 \n Locally Advanced or Metastatic EGFR -Mutated Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer  \n \nTROPION -Lung05, TROPION -Lung01, TROPION -PanTumor01  \n \nThe safety of DATROWAY was evaluated in 125 patients with EGFR -mutated NSCLC who received \nDATROWAY 6 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks (21 -day cycle) until disease \nprogression or unacceptable toxicity in TROPION -Lung05 and TR OPION -Lung01 as well as TROPION -\nPanTumor01 (NCT03401385). Among these patients, the median duration of treatment was 6.1 months (range \n0.7 months to 41.7 months).  \n \nThe median age was 63 years (range: 36 to 81), 56% of patients were <65 years, 62% of patients were female; \n66% were Asian, 26% were White, 0.8% were Black, 6% were other races; and 2.4% were of Hispanic \nethnicity.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 26% of patients who received DATROWAY.

Adverse reactions \nwhich required dose reduction in >1% of patients included stomatitis (14%), keratitis (1.6%), fatigue (1.6%), \ndecreased weight (1.6%) and COVID -19 (1.6%).  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were stomatitis (71%), nausea \n(50%), alopecia (49%), fatigue (42%), decreased hemoglobin (34%), decreased lymphocytes (32%), \nconstipation (31%), increased calcium (31%), increase d AST (28%), decreased white blood cell count (27%), \nincreased lactate dehydrogenase (23%), musculoskeletal pain (22%), decreased appetite (20%), increased ALT \n(20%), and rash (20%).  \n \nClinically relevant adverse reactions occurring in <10% of patients who received DATROWAY included dry \nskin, blurred vision, abdominal pain, conjunctivitis, dry mouth, ILD/pneumonitis, skin hyperpigmentation, \nincreased lacrimation, and visual impairment.  \n \nUnresectable or Metastatic, HR -Positive, HER2 -Negative Breast Cancer  \n \nTROPION -Breast01  \n \nThe safety of DATROWAY was evaluated in 360 patients with unresectable or metastatic HR -positive, HER2 -\nnegative (IHC 0, IHC1+ or IHC2+/ISH -) breast cancer who received at least one dose of DATROWAY 6 mg/kg \nin TROPION -Breast01. DATROWAY was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The\n10 \n median duration of treatment was 6.7 months (range: 0.7 months to 16.1 months) for patients who received \nDATROWAY.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients who received DATROWAY. Serious adverse reactions in \n>0.5% of patients who received DATROWAY were urinary tract infection (1.9%), COVID -19 infection (1.7%), \nILD/pneumonitis (1.1%), acute kidney injury, p ulmonary embolism, vomiting, diarrhea, hemiparesis, and \nanemia (0.6% each). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 0.3% of patients who received DATROWAY and were \ndue to ILD/pneumonitis.  \n \nPermanent discontinuation of DATROWAY due to an adverse reaction occurred in 3.1% of patients. Adverse \nreactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of DATROWAY in >0.5% of patients included \nILD/pneumonitis (1.7%) and fatigue (0.6%).  \n \nDosage interruptions of DATROWAY due to an adverse reaction occurred in 22% of patients.

Adverse reactions \nwhich required dose reduction in >1% of patients included stomatitis (13%), fatigue (3.1%), nausea (2.5%), and \nweight decrease (1.9%).  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were stomatitis (59%), nausea \n(56%), fatigue (44%), decreased leukocytes (41%), decreased calcium (39%), alopecia (38%), decreased \nlymphocytes (36%), decreased hemoglobin (35%), constipation (34%), decreased neutrophils (30%), dry eye \n(27%), vomiting (24%), increased ALT (24%), keratitis (24%), increased AST (23%), and increased alkaline \nphosphatase (23%).  \n \nClinically relevant adverse reactions occurring in <10% of patients who received DATROWAY included \ninfusion -related reactions (including bronchospasm), ILD/pneumonitis, headache, pruritus, dry skin, dry mouth, \nconjunctivitis, blepharitis, meibomian gland d ysfunction, blurred vision, increased lacrimation, photophobia, \nvisual impairment, skin hyperpigmentation, and madarosis.  \n \nUse in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy: Based on its mechanism of action, DATROWAY can cause embryo -fetal harm when \nadministered to a pregnant woman because the topoisomerase inhibitor component of DATROWAY, \nDXd, is genotoxic and affects actively dividing cells. There are no available data on th e use of \nDATROWAY in pregnant women to inform a drug -associated risk. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus.  \n• Lactation: There are no data regarding the presence of datopotamab deruxtecan -dlnk or its metabolites \nin human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the \npotential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, ad vise women not to breastfeed during \ntreatment with DATROWAY and for 1 month after the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy Testing:  Verify pregnancy status of \nfemales of reproductive potential prior to initiation of DATROWAY.  Contraception:  Females:  Advise \nfemales of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DATROWAY \nand for 7 months after the last dose. Males:  Because of the potential for genotoxicity, advise male \npatients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment \nwith DATROWAY and for 4  months after the last dose. Infertility:  Based on findings in animal toxicity\n11 \n studies, DATROWAY may impair male and female reproductive function and fertility. The effects on \nreproductive organs in animals were irreversible.  \n• Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of DATROWAY have not been established in pediatric \npatients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 125 patients with EGFR -mutated NSCLC in TROPION -Lung05, TROPION -\nLung01, TROPION -PanTumor01 treated with DATROWAY 6 mg/kg, 44% were ≥65 years of age and \n10% were ≥75 years of age. No clinically meaningful differences in efficacy and safety were obser ved \nbetween patients ≥65 years of age versus younger patients. Of the 365 patients in TROPION -Breast01 \ntreated with DATROWAY 6 mg/kg, 25% were ≥65 years of age and 5% were ≥75 years of age. Grade \n≥3 and serious adverse reactions were more co mmon in patients ≥65 years (42% and 25%, respectively) \ncompared to patients <65 years (33% and 15%, respectively). In TROPION -Breast01, no other \nmeaningful differences in safety or efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years of age versus \nyounger pat ients.  \n• Renal Impairment: A higher incidence of ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with mild \nand moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 30 to <90 mL/min). Monitor patients with \nrenal impairment for increased adverse reactions, including respiratory reacti ons. No dosage adjustment \nis recommended in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of severe renal \nimpairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) on the pharmacokinetics of datopotamab deruxtecan -dlnk or DXd is \nunknown.  \n• Hepatic Impairment: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment \n(total bilirubin ≤ULN and any AST >ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST). \nLimited data are available in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubi n >1.5 to 3 times \nULN and any AST). Monitor patients with moderate hepatic impairment for increased adverse \nreactions. The recommended dosage of DATROWAY has not been established for patients with severe \nhepatic impairment (total biliru bin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA -1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, \nand Medication Guide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the world. \nWith more than 120 years of experie nce, Daiichi Sankyo leverages its world -class science and technology to \ncreate new modalities and innovative medicines for people with cancer, cardiovascular and other diseases with \nhigh unmet medical need.

Results were  presented today (LBA1 ) alongside the results of \nDESTINY -Breast11  (291O ) in Presidential Symposium I  at the 2025 European Society for Medical \nOncology (#ESMO25)  Congress .  \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by \nDaiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and being jointly developed and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo and \nAstraZeneca (LSE/STO/NASDAQ: AZN) .  \n In the primary endpoint analysis, ENHERTU significantly reduced the risk of invasive disease recurrence or death ( invasive disease- free survival [IDFS]) by 53 % (hazard ratio [HR ]=0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI]: \n0.34- 0.66;  p<0.0001) compared to T -DM1 as a post -neoadjuvant treatment. ENHERTU demonstrated a \nthree -year IDFS rate of 92.4% (95% CI: 89.7- 94.4) compared to 83.7% with T -DM1  (95% CI: 80.2- 86.7). \nIDFS findings were consistent across all  prespecified  subgroups .  \n In the key secondary endpoint analysis of  disease- free survival  (DFS), ENHERTU also significantly reduced \nthe risk of disease recurrence or death  by 53% (HR=0.47; 95% CI: 0.34- 0.66; p<0.0001) compared to T -\nDM1 as a post -neoadjuvant treatment . The three-year DFS rate for ENHERTU was 92.3% (95% CI: 89.5-\n94.3) compared to 83.5% with T -DM1  (95% CI: 79.9- 86.4) . Treatment with ENHERTU also reduced the\n2 \n risk of distant disease recurrence (d istant recurrence- free interval  [DRF I]) by 51% (HR=0.49 ; 95% CI: 0.34-\n0.71) and the risk of brain metastases (brain metastasis -free interval  [BMFI ]) by 36% (HR= 0.64; 95% CI: \n0.35- 1.17) versus T -DM1. DRFI a t three  years was 93.9% with ENHERTU (95% CI: 91.4- 95.7) compared to \n86.1% with T -DM1 (95% CI: 82.5- 89.1) . BMFI at three  years w as 97.6% with ENHERTU (95% CI: 96.2-\n98.5) compared to 95.8% with  T-DM1 (95% CI: 93.6- 97.2).  \n \nOverall survival (OS) was not mature at the time of this planned interim analysis  (2.9% maturity at data cut -\noff) and will be assessed in future analyses (HR=0.61; 95% CI: 0.34- 1.10) .  \n \n“For patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant treatment, the post -neoadjuvant setting represents a \ncritical second opportunity to reduce recurrence risk, and in DESTINY -Breast05 ENHERTU reduced the risk \nof early recurrence or death by 53% compared to the current standard of T -DM1 ,” said Charles Geyer , MD, \nChief Scientific Officer of the  NSABP Foundation , Professor of Medicine at the UPMC Hillman Cancer \nCenter  in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and P rincipal I nvestigator  for the  trial. “These  results, coupled with the \nsafety data from the trial, are likely to transform clinical practice  in the post -neoadjuvant setting for patients \nwith high -risk disease , with the  potential for ENHERTU to set a new standard of care.”   \n \nThe safety profile of ENHERTU observed in DESTINY -Breast05 was consistent with its known profile with \nno new safety concerns identified. Grade 3 or higher t reatment emergent adverse event ( TEAE) rates were \ncomparable between ENHERTU  (50.6% ) and T -DM1  (51.9%) . The most common grade 3 or higher TEAEs  \noccurr ing in 5%  or more  of patients treated with ENHERTU were decreased neutrophil count (15.5%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (10.0%) and decreased platelet count (6.7%) . Rates of interstitial lung \ndisease (ILD) or pneumonitis were low in both arms with ILD events occurring in 9.6%  of the ENHERTU \narm and 1.6% of the T -DM1 arm. The majority of ILD or pneumonitis events were low grade (grade 1 \n[ENHERTU =16; 2.0% ; T-DM1 =8; 1.0% ] or grade 2  [n=52; 6.5% ; T-DM1=5; 0.6% ]). There were no grade 3 \nor higher ILD  or pneumonitis  events for T -DM1. In the ENHERTU arm , there were seven grade 3 events \n(0.9%), zero grade 4 events and two grade 5 events (0.2%) as determined by an independent adjudication committee . \n \n“The results of DESTINY -Breast05 demonstrate a clear benefit of ENHERTU over the current standard of \ncare following surgery in patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence after \nneoadjuvant treatment , improving their chance for sustained long- term outcomes ,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, \nGlobal Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “ These results, coupled with the results of DESTINY -Breast11, \nillustrate the continued promise of ENHERTU to move earlier in the breast cancer  treatment paradigm whe re \nit can have the greatest impact on the lives of patients.”\n3 \n “Progress  in treating HER2  positive early breast cancer  has been significant, yet managing patients at a \nhigher -risk of recurrence remains challenging ,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice \nPresident, Oncology Hematology R&D, AstraZeneca. “These landmark data , alongside those from \nDESTINY -Breast11 , underscore  the potential of ENHERTU to become a foundational treatment in early -\nstage breast cancer , increasing the likelihood that  more patients could be  cure d in this setting .” \n \nAll p atients in the DESTINY -Breast 05 trial had received prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy and HER2 \ntargeted ther apy and the majority of patients received either concurrent (ENHERTU=53.5%; T -\nDM1=58.8%) or sequential (ENHERTU=39.9%; T -DM1=34.1%) radiotherapy treatment . The majority of \npatients were pathologic node positive following neoadjuvant treatment  (ENHERTU=80.7%; T -\nDM1= 80.5%). As of the data cut -off date of July 2, 2025, the median study duration was 29.9  months in the \nENHERTU arm (range: 0.3 -53.4) and 29.7 months in the T -DM1 arm (range: 0.1- 54.4).  \n \nSummary of DESTINY -Breast 05 Interim Analysis Results  \nEfficacy Measure  ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) (n= 818) T-DM1  (n=817) \nIDFS i,ii,iii,iv \nHR (95% CI) = 0.47  (0.34 -0.66); p<0.0001  \n3-year IDFS  % \n(95% CI ) 92.4% (89.7 -94.4)  83.7% (80.2 -86.7)  \nTotal IDFS events n  (%) 51 (6.2)  102 (12.5)  \nCategory of first IDFS event , niii \nDistant recurrent CNS  \nDistant recurrence (non- CNS ) \nLocal invasive recurrence  \nRegional recurrence  \nContralateral invasive recurrence  \nDeath without prior event   \n17 \n25 \n1 \n1 \n0 \n7  \n25 \n52 \n5 \n6 \n6 \n8 \nDFS i,ii,v \nHR (95% CI)  = 0.47; (0.34 -0.66); p<0.0001  \n3-year DFS %  (95% CI)  92.3% (89.5 -94.3)  83.5% (79.9 -86.4)  \nTotal DFS events n  (%) 52 (6.4) 103 (12.6) \nDRFI ii,vi \nPatients with events (recurrence), n  (%) 42 (5.1)  81 (9.9)  \n3-year event -free rate, %  (95% CI)  93.9 (91.4 -95.7)  86.1 (82.5 -89.1)  \nHR (95% CI) = 0.49 (0.34 -0.71)  \nBMFIii,vii \nPatients with events (recurrence), n  (%) 17 (2.1)  26 (3.2)  \n3-year event -free rate, %  (95% CI)  97.6 (96.2 -98.5)  95.8 (93. 6-97.2)  \nHR (95% CI) = 0. 64 (0.35-1.17) \nOSviii \nPatients with events ( deaths ), n (%) 18 (2.2) 29 (3.5) \nSurvival at 3 years , % (95% CI)  97.4 (95.8-98.4) 95.7 (93.5 -97.2)  \nHR (95% CI) = 0.6 1; (0.34-1.10) \nBMFI, brain -metastasis -free interval; CI, confidence interval; CNS, central nervous system; DFS, disease -free survival; DRFI, distant \nrecurrence-free interval; HR, hazard ratio; IDFS, invasive disease-free survival; OS, overall survival  \ni IDFS and DFS, the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, were statistically evaluated using the pre-specified hierarchical \ntesting procedure.\n4 \n ii Based  on investigator assessment  \niii IDFS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of first occurrence of one of the following events: recurrence of \nipsilateral invasive breast tumor, recurrence of ipsilateral l ocoregional invasive breast cancer, contralateral invasive breast cancer, a \ndistant disease recurrence or death from any cause  \niv Patients who experienced multiple types of IDFS events within 61 days after their first event are reported in the category according \nto the following hierarchy: distant recurrence  CNS, distant recurrence non -CNS, local invasive recurrence, regional recurrence, \ncontralateral breast cancer, death without a previous event  \nv DFS is defined as the time between randomization and the date of first occurrence of an IDFS event per STEEP criteria, including \nsecond primary non- breast cancer event  or contralateral or ipsilateral ductal carcinoma in situ  (DCIS) \nvi DRFI is defined as the time between randomization and the date of distant breast cancer recurrence \nvii BMFI is defined as the time between randomization and the date of documentation of brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease  \nviii OS was 2.9% mature at interim analysis  \n \nDESTINY -Breast05 was  conducted in collaboration with the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel \nProject Foundation (NSABP), the German Breast Group (GBG), Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynäkologische Onkologie (AGO -B) and SOLTI Breast Cancer Research Group.  \n \nAbout  DESTINY- Breast 05 \nDESTINY -Breast05\n is a global, multicenter, randomized, open- label, phase  3 trial evaluating the efficacy  \nand safety  of ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg)  versus  T-DM1  in patients with  HER2  positive  primary  breast  cancer  \nwith residual  invasive  disease in  breast  or axillary  lymph  nodes  following  neoadjuvant  therapy and a  high  \nrisk of recurrence.  High risk of recurrence  was defined as presentation with  inoperable cancer (prior to \nneoadjuvant therapy) or pathologically positive axillary lymph nodes following neoadjuvant therapy.  \n \nThe primary  endpoint  of DESTINY -Breast05  is investigator -assessed  IDFS . IDFS  is defined as the  time from  \nrandomization  until  first recurrence,  distant  recurrence or  death  from  any cause.  The key secondary  endpoint  \nis investigator -assessed  DFS . Other  secondary endpoints  include  OS, DRFI , BMFI  and s afety.   \n DESTINY -Breast05  enrolled  1,635 patients in Asia,  Europe, North  America,  Oceania  and South  America.  \nFor more  information  about  the trial, visit  ClinicalTrials.gov.  \n \nAbout Post Neoadjuvant HER2 Positive  Early Breast Cancer \nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.\n1 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022, with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally.1 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast cancer.2 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a result of HER2 gene \namplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in breast cancer.2 \nApproximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.3\n5 \n For patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer, achieving pCR with neoadjuvant treatment is the \nearliest indicator of improved long -term survival.4 However, approximately half of patients who receive \nneoadjuvant treatment do not reach  pCR and have poorer long- term outcomes , putting them at increased risk \nof disease recurrence.4,5,6,7,8,9  \n \nDespite receiving  additional treatment  with T -DM1  for residual disease in the post -neoadjuvant setting, \napproximately 20% of patients still experience invasive disease or death, with no reduction in the risk of \ncentral nervous system  (CNS ) recurrence.10,11 Once patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease, the five-\nyear survival rate drops from nearly 90% to approximately 30 %.12  \n \nPost-neoadjuvant therapy represents a key opportunity to minimi ze the risk of recurrence and prevent \nprogression to metastatic disease  for patients with residual disease.  New treatment options are needed in the \nearly breast cancer setting to  help reduce the likelihood of disease progression and improve long- term \noutcomes for more patients . \n About ENHERTU  ENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.

Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and \ndescription of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, \ndyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue \nENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk \nand to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of \nthese risks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n Warnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Cons ider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose 1 level . Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n HER2 -Positive, HER2- Low, and HER2- Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (range: \n0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonit is occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with \nENHERTU.  \n HER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: \n1.2 to 21).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated.\n9 \n For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 \nx 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2- Low, and HER2- Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Nineteen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time t o first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 \ndays (range: 2 to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.2% of patients.  \n HER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty- one percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Media n time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 \ndays (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is 20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. \nIf LVEF of 20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \npatients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHER TU has not been studied in \npatients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2- Low, and HER2- Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 4.6% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3 or 4.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive poten tial to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after th e last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until  \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level.\n10 \n Adverse Reactions  \nHER2 -Positive, HER2- Low, and HER2- Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer , HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \n2233 patients in Study DS8201- A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast02, \nDESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -Breast04, DESTINY -Breast06, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY -Lung02, \nDESTINY -CRC02, and DESTINY -PanTumor02.

Advise patients \nof the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant \nwomen, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions \nin a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during tre atment with ENHERTU and for 7 months \nafter the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females \nof reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : ENHERTU can \ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to \nuse effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 1741 patients with HER2- positive, HER2- low, or HER2- ultralow breast cancer \ntreated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 24% were ≥65 years and 4.9% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 year s of age compared \nto younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients \naged ≥65 years (61%) as compared to younger patients (52%). Of the 101 patients with HER2- mutant \nunresectable or metastat ic NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% \nwere ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with HER2- positive locally advanced or \nmetastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, \n56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed \nbetween patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2- positive \n(IHC 3+) unresectable or metastatic solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -\nPanTumor02, DESTINY -Lung01, or DESTINY -CRC02, 39% were ≥65 years and 9% were ≥75 years. \nNo overall differences in  efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared \nto younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic\n14 \n impairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the \nworld.

Pathologic complete response is defined as no evidence \nof invasive cancer cells in the removed breast tissue and lymph nodes following treatment. Results were  \npresented today (291O ) alongside the results from the DESTINY -Breast05 ( LBA1 ) phase 3 trial during \nPresidential Symposium I  at the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (#ESMO25)  Congress .  \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by \nDaiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and being jointly developed and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo and \nAstraZeneca  (LSE/STO/NASDAQ: AZN) .  \n \nIn the trial,  ENHERTU followed by THP  resulted in a  pCR rate of  67.3% compared to  56.3% with ddAC -\nTHP, representing a pCR rate improvement  of 11.2 % (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.0-18.3; p=0.003 ). \nImprovement s in pCR rates were observed across both HR positive and HR negative subgroups.  After \nsurgery, 81.3% of patients who received  neoadjuvant therapy in the ENHERTU followed by THP  arm had \nno or minimal residual invasive cancer ( Residual Cancer Burden [RCB ] 0+I) detected in the resected breast \nor lymph node tissue compared to  69.1% of patients in the comparator arm .\n2 \n The secondary endpoint of event -free survival (EFS) was not mature at the time of this analysis  (4.5% \nmaturity at  data cut -off); however , an early analysis  showed a trend favoring  ENHERTU followed by THP \nversus ddAC -THP  (HR= 0.56; 95% CI: 0.26 -1.17) .  \n \n“For patients with early breast cancer who are at high risk of disease recurrence, using  the most effective \ntreatment option at the earliest opportunity is critical to prevent recurrence , optimize  safety and  improve  the \npotential for cure ,” said Nadia Harbeck, Director of Breast Center , Cancer Department of OB&GYN  and \nCCC Munich , LMU University Hospital , Germany and Principal Investigator  for the  trial. “In the DESTINY -\nBreast11 trial, more than two-thirds of patients had a pathologic complete response with trastuzumab \nderuxtecan  followed by THP, suggesting a potential new standard of care in the neoadjuvant setting for \npatients with  high-risk, HER2  positive early breast cancer .”  \n \nThe safety profile of ENHERTU followed by THP in DESTINY -Breast11 was consistent with the known \nprofiles of each individual therapy with no new safety concerns identified . ENHERTU followed by THP \nshowed a favorable  safety profile compared to ddAC -THP  with reduced rates of g rade 3 or higher treatment \nemergent adverse events ( TEAEs) (ENHERTU followed by THP= 37.5% ; ddAC -THP= 55.8% ), serious \nadverse events ( AEs) (ENHERTU followed by THP=10.6% ; ddAC -THP= 20.2%), treatment interruptions \n(ENHERTU followed by THP= 37.8% ; ddAC -THP= 54.5%) and left ventricular dysfunction ( ENHERTU \nfollowed by THP= 1.3% ; ddAC -THP= 6.1%) . The most common grade 3 or higher TEAEs occurring in 5% or \nmore of patients treated with ENHERTU followed by THP were neutropenia (13.8%), diarrhea (5.9%)  and \nincreased transaminases (5 .0%). Rates of i nterstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis were low and similar \nbetween arms  with ILD events occurring in 4.4% (n=14/32 0) of patients treated with ENHERTU followed \nby THP  compared to 5.1% (n=16/312)  in those treated with ddAC -THP . The majority of ILD or pneumonitis \nevents were low grade (grade 1  or grade 2 [ENHERTU followed by THP =12; ddAC -THP= 10]), with one \ngrade 3 or grade 4 events  in the ENHERTU  followed by THP  arm and five grade 3 or 4 events in the ddAC -\nTHP arm . There was  one grade 5 ILD event in each arm as determined by an independent adjudication \ncommittee .   \n \n“While achieving a pathologic complete  response  in HER2 positive early -stage breast cancer  is critical for \nreducing disease recurrence and improving long -term prognosi s, approximately half of patients still show \nevidence of residual disease following surgery with currently available neoadjuvant treatment options ,” said \nKen Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo.  “The results from DESTINY -Breast11  show that \ntreatment with ENHERTU  followed by THP prior to surgery resulted in no  evidence of  residual invasive \ndisease in two-thirds  of patients, illustrating the first  treatment regimen in more than a decade to  significantly \nimprove outcomes in the earliest treatment setting for HER2  positive breast cancer .”\n3 \n “The goal of treatment in the early breast cancer setting is to provide  patients with the best possible chance \nfor cure while optimizing the tolerability of the treatment regimen ,” said  Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, \nExecutive Vice President, Oncology Hematology R&D, AstraZeneca . “The impressive pathologic response \nrates and favorable  safety profile seen with ENHERTU followed by THP in DESTINY -Breast11 have the \npotential to transform treatment in the neoadjuvant setting and underscore the importance of bringing \nENHERTU into earlier stages  of HER2 positive disease .”  \n \nApproximately half of patients in DESTINY -Breast11 had a primary clinical tumor stage of  0-2 (cT0-2; \nENHERTU followed by THP =54.8%; ddAC -THP =58.8%) and nearly half ha d a primary clinical tumor stage \nof 3-4 (cT3 -4; ENHERTU followed by THP =45.2%; ddAC -THP =41.3% ). The m ajority of patients were \nnode positive (ENHERTU followed by THP =89.4%; ddAC -THP =87.8%)  and had an ECOG  PS (Eastern \nCooperative Oncology Group performance status)  of 0 (ENHERTU followed by THP =86.6%; ddAC -\nTHP =87.5%) . Nearly all patients underwent surgery following neoadjuvant treatment  (ENHERTU followed \nby THP =97.2%; ddAC -THP =93.8%). As of  the data cut -off date of  March 12, 2025, the median duration of \nfollow -up was 24. 3 months in the ENHERTU followed by THP  arm and 23.6 months in the ddAC -THP  arm. \n \nSummary of DESTINY -Breast11 Primary  Results  \nEfficacy Measure  ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg ; 4 cycles ) \nfollowed by THP  (4 cycles)  \n(n=321)  ddAC -THP  \n(4 cycles) (n=320)  \npCRi \npCR rate %ii 67.3%  56.3%  \nΔpCR % (95% CI)ii,iii 11.2% (4.0-18.3)  \np=0.003  \nHormone receptor  positive  subgroup pCR rate %ii 61.4% 52.3% \nΔpCR % (95% CI)ii,iii 9.1% (0.2-17.9)  \nHormone receptor  negative  subgroup pCR rate %ii 83.1% 67.1% \nΔpCR % (95% CI)ii,iii 16.1% (3.0-28.8)  \nRCB (0+I)i,iv \nRCB (0+I)  rate %  81.3%  69.1% \nΔRCB %  12.2%  \nRCB -I rate % 68.8% 57.5%  \nRCB -0 rate %  12.5%  11.6%  \nHormone receptor  positive subgroup RCB (0+I) \nrate % 78.0%  64.7%  \nΔRCB  % (95% CI)  13.3% \nHormone receptor positive RCB -I rate %  63.1%  52.8%  \nHormone receptor positive RCB -0 rate %  14.8%  11.9%  \nHormone receptor negative subgroup RCB (0+I)  \nrate %  90.4%  81.2%  \nΔRCB  % (95% CI)  9.2% \nHormone receptor negative RCB -I rate %  84.3%  70.6%  \nHormone receptor negative RCB -0 rate %  6.0%  10.6%  \nEFSi,v,vi \n2-year EFS %  \n(95% CI)  96.9% (95% CI 93.5 -98.6)  93.1% (88.7 -95.8)  \nHR= 0.56 (0.26, 1.17)\n4 \n CI, confidence interval; EFS, event -free survival ; HR, hazard ratio; pCR, pathologic complete response ; RCB  (0+I), residual cancer \nburden   \ni Based on blinded central review  \nii pCR responders were defined as patients who only received randomized study treatment (at least one dose) and had pCR  \niii Stratified Miettinen & Nurminen method; p value crossed the 0.03 prespecified boundary  \niv RCB is based on raw data and is not corrected for non -starters, or any bridging/off study neoadjuvant treatment; therefore, there \nmay be differences between pCR and RCB -0 \nv EFS was 4.5% mature at interim analysis  \nvi Median duration of follow up was 24.3 months with ENHERTU followed by THP  and 23.6 months with ddAC -THP  \n \nThe ENHERTU monotherapy arm (n=28 6) was closed  early  following a recommendation from the \nIndependent Data Monitoring Committee (I DMC ). The recommendation was based on multiple factors  \nincluding a lower pCR rate, low likelihood that ENHERTU  alone would be superior to ddAC -THP, and the \ntiming of surgery . The recommendation  was not related to safety . \n \nA supplemental  Biologics  License  Application  for ENHERTU  followed  by THP  based  on data from  \nDESTINY -Breast11  is currently  under  review  by the U.S. Food  and Drug  Administration  (FDA ).  \n \nAbout  DESTINY -Breast 11  \nDESTINY -Breast11  is a global, multicenter, randomized, open -label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy \nand safety of neoadjuvant ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) monotherapy or ENHERTU followed by THP (paclitaxel, \ntrastuzumab and pertuzumab) versus ddAC -THP in patients with high -risk (lymph node positive [N1 -3] or \nprimary tumor stage T3 -4), locally advanced or inflammatory HER2 positive early -stage breast cancer.  \n \nPatients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either eight cycles of ENHERTU monotherapy; four cycles of \nENHERTU followed by four cycles of THP; or four cycles of ddAC  followed by four cycles of THP.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY -Breast11 is rate of pCR (absence of invasive disease in the breast and \nlymph nodes). Secondary endpoints include EFS, invasive disease -free survival, overall survival and safety.  \n \nDESTINY -Breast11 enrolled 927 patients across multiple sites in Asia, Europe, North America and South \nAmerica.

Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, \ndyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue \nENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk \nand to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of \nthese risks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life -threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Cons ider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose 1 level . Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients.

Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is 20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. \nIf LVEF of 20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \npatients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHER TU has not been studied in \npatients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 4.6% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3 or 4.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive poten tial to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after th e last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until  \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level.\n10 \n Adverse Reactions  \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer , HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \n2233 patients in Study DS8201 -A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast02, \nDESTINYBreast03, DESTINY -Breast04, DESTINY -Breast06, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY -Lung02, \nDESTINY -CRC02, and DESTINY -PanTumor02.

The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, \ndecreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased \nhemoglobin (75%), decreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (72%), decreased \nlymphocyte count (70%), decreased platelet count (68%), nause a (63%), decreased appetite (60%), increased \naspartate aminotransferase (58%), fatigue (55%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (54%), increased \nalanine aminotransferase (47%), diarrhea (32%), decreased blood potassium (30%), vomiting (26%), \nconstipatio n (24%), increased blood bilirubin (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \n \nHER2 -Positive (IHC 3+) Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 347 adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive \n(IHC 3+) solid tumors who received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks in DESTINY -\nBreast01, DESTINY -PanTumor02, DESTINY -Lung01, and DESTI NY-CRC02. The median duration of \ntreatment was 8.3 months (range 0.7 to 30.2).  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 34% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were sepsis, pneumonia, vomiting, urinary tract infection, \nabdominal pain, nausea, pneumonitis, pleural effusion, hem orrhage, COVID -19, fatigue, acute kidney injury, \nanemia, cellulitis, and dyspnea. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 6.3% of patients including \nILD/pneumonitis (2.3%), cardiac arrest (0.6%), COVID -19 (0.6%), and sepsis (0.6%). The following ev ents \noccurred in 1 patient each (0.3%): acute kidney injury, cerebrovascular accident, general physical health \ndeterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.\n13 \n  \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis accounted for 10%. \nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 48% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions \n(>2%) associated with dose interruption were d ecreased neutrophil count, anemia, COVID -19, fatigue, \ndecreased white blood cell count, and ILD/pneumonitis. Dose reductions occurred in 27% of patients treated \nwith ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fat igue, \nnausea, decreased neutrophil count, ILD/pneumonitis, and diarrhea.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased white \nblood cell count (75%), nausea (69%), decreased hemoglobin (67%), decreased neutrophil count (66%), \nfatigue (59%), decreased lymphocyte count (58%), decrease d platelet count (51%), increased aspartate \naminotransferase (45%), increased alanine aminotransferase (44%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase \n(36%), vomiting (35%), decreased appetite (34%), alopecia (34%), diarrhea (31%), decreased blood \npotassium (2 9%), constipation (28%), decreased sodium (22%), stomatitis (20%), and upper respiratory tract \ninfection (20%).  \n \nUse in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients \nof the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant \nwomen, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions \nin a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during tre atment with ENHERTU and for 7 months \nafter the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing : Verify pregnancy status of females \nof reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : ENHERTU can \ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to \nuse effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 1741 patients with HER2 -positive, HER2 -low, or HER2 -ultralow breast cancer \ntreated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 24% were ≥65 years and 4.9% were ≥75 years. No overall \ndifferences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 year s of age compared \nto younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients \naged ≥65 years (61%) as compared to younger patients (52%). Of the 101 patients with HER2 -mutant \nunresectable or metastat ic NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% \nwere ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of \nage compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with HER2 -positive locally adv anced or \nmetastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, \n56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed \nbetween patients ≥65 years of age compared to young er patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2 -positive \n(IHC 3+) unresectable or metastatic solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -\nPanTumor02, DESTINY -Lung01, or DESTINY -CRC02, 39% were ≥65 years and 9% were ≥75 years. \nNo overall differences in  efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared \nto younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic\n14 \n impairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA -1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the \nworld.

The Priority Review follows receipt of  Breakthrough Therapy Designation  granted  by the FDA in \nJuly 2025.  \n \nAbout  DESTINY -Breast09   \nDESTINY -Breast09  is a global, multicenter, randomized, open -label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy \nand safety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) either alone or in combination with pertuzumab versus standard of care \nTHP (a taxane [docetaxel or paclitaxel], trastuzumab and pertuzumab) as a fi rst-line treatment in patients \nwith HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.  \n \nPatients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either ENHERTU monotherapy with a pertuzumab matching \nplacebo; ENHERTU in combination with pertuzumab; or THP. Randomization was stratif ied by prior \ntreatment ( de novo  metastatic disease versus progression from early -stage disease), hormone receptor (HR) \nstatus and PIK3CA  mutation status.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY -Breast09 is progression -free survival ( PFS) as assessed by blinded \nindependent central review in both the ENHERTU monotherapy and ENHERTU combination arms. \nSecondary endpoints include investigator -assessed PFS,  overall survival , objective response rate, duration of \nresponse, pharmacokinetics and sa fety. The investigational arm assessing ENHERTU monotherapy versus \nTHP remains blinded to patients and investigators and will continue to the final PFS analysis.   \n \nDESTINY -Breast09 enrolled  1,157 patients across  multiple  sites in Africa, Asia, Europe, Nort h America, \nand South America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov .  \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.5 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022, with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally.5 In Japan, b reast cancer is the most common cancer in women , with approxima tely 92,000 \ncases of breast cancer diagnosed and 17,600 deaths  in 2022 .6 While survival rates are high for those \ndiagnosed with early breast cancer, only ab out 30%  of patients diagnosed with or progress to metastatic \ndisease are expected to live five years following diagnosis.7 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast cancer.8 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a result of HER2  gene \namplification.1 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.9\n3 \n HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer is an aggressive disease driven by overexpression or ampl ification of \nHER2 that affects 15% to 20% of patients with metastatic breast cancer.10 While HER2 targeted therapies \nhave improved outcomes, prognosis remains poor with most patients experiencing disease progression within \ntwo years of first -line treatment with THP, which has been the standard of care for more than a decade.1,2,3,4 \nFurther, approximately 25% to 30%  of patients do not receive  any treatment following first -line therapy due \nto discontinuation  or death .11,12,13 \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo an d the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n \nENHERT U (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 85 countries/regions  worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or in -situ \nhybridization (ISH)+) breast cancer who have received a prior anti-HER2 -based regimen, either in the \nmetastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or \nwithin six months of completing therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 85 countries/regions worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have \nreceiv ed a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within \nsix months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast0 4 trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 4 5 countries/regions  worldwide  for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/  \nISH-) or HER2 ultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by a locally or \nregionally approved test, that have progressed on one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting \nbased on the results from the DESTINY -Breast06  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 60 countries/regions worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2 ) mutations, as \ndetected by a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on \nthe results from the DESTINY -Lung 02 and/or DESTINY -Lung05  trials.  Continued approval in China and \nthe U.S. for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a \nconfirmatory trial.\n4 \n  \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 70 countries/regions worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) gastric or \ngastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have re ceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen \nbased on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric02  and/or DESTINY -Gastric06  trials.  \nContinued approval in China for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 10 countries/regions worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior \nsystemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options based on e fficacy results from the \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 , DESTINY -Lung01  and DESTINY -CRC02  trials. Continued approval for this \nindication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU as a monotherapy or in combination or sequentially with other cancer medicines  across multiple \nHER2 targetable cancers.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo  and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU  in March 2019  and DATROW AY® in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmainta ins exclusive rights for each ADC.

We look forward to\n2 \n  \ndiscussing these data with global regulatory authorities  and to bring ing DATROWAY to patients with triple \nnegative breast cancer as soon as possi ble.”  \n \n“TROPION -Breast02 is the only trial ever to show a n overall survival  benefit  in the first -line treatment of  \npatients with metastatic triple negative breast  cancer  for whom immunotherapy  is not an option ,” said Susan \nGalbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology Hematology R&D, AstraZeneca. “ We \nexpect today’s  results will mark an inflection point in the treatment of these patients who have the poorest \nprognosis of any type of breast cancer an d urgently need better options .”  \n \nThe safety profile of DATROWAY was consistent with previous clinical trials of DATROWAY  in breast \ncancer. These d ata from TROPION -Breast02 will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and shared \nwith regulatory authorities.  \n \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca are evaluating DATROWAY across stages and treatment settings of TNBC \nin three additional phase 3 trials . TROPION -Breast03  is evaluating  DATROWAY as adjuvant therapy with \nor without AstraZeneca’s anti -PD-L1 therapy durvalumab versus investigator’s choice of therapy in patients \nwith stage I-III TNBC  with residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant systemic therapy . TROPION -\nBreast04  is evaluating  neoadjuvant DATROWAY plus durvalumab versus neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus \nchemotherapy in patients with  stage II-III triple negative  or hormone receptor (HR) low, HER2  low or  \nnegative breast cancer . TROPION -Breast05  is evaluating first-line DATROWAY with or without \ndurvalumab versus investigator’s choice of therapy in patients with metastatic TNBC whose tumors express \nPD-L1.  \n  \nAbout TROPION -Breast 02 \nTROPION -Breast02  is a global, multicenter , randomized, open -label phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and \nsafety of DATROWAY versus investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel, nab -pacli taxel, \ncapecitabine, carboplatin or eribulin) in patients with previously untreated locally recurrent inoperable or \nmetastatic TNBC for whom immunotherapy was not an option . This included patients whose tumors d id not \nexpress PD -L1 as well as patients with PD -L1 expressing tumors who could not receive immunotherapy  due \nto prior exposure in early -stage disease, comorbidities or immunotherapy not being accessible in their \ngeography. Enrol lment included patients with d e novo or recurrent disease, regardless of disease -free \ninterval, and those with poor prognostic factors such as brain metastases.\n3 \n  \nThe dual primary endpoints of TROPION -Breast02 are PFS assessed by blinded independent central review \nand OS. Key s econdary endpoints include PFS as assessed by investigator, objective response rate, duration \nof response, disease control rate, pharmacokinetics and safety.  \n \nTROPION -Breast02 enrolled 644 patients at sites in Africa, Asia , Europe , North America  and South \nAmerica . For more information visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Triple Negative Breast Cancer  \nTNBC accounts for approximately 15% of all breast canc er cases, with an estimated 345,000 diagnoses \nglobally each year.3,4 TNBC is diagnosed more frequently in younger and premenopausal women, and is \nmore prevalent in Black and Hispanic women.5,6,7  Metastatic TNBC is the most aggressive type of breast \ncancer and has the worst prognosis, with median overall survival of just 12 to 18 months and only about 14% \nof patients living five years following diagnosis.5,8,9 \n  \nWhile some breast cancers may test positive for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors or overexpression \nof HER2, TNBC tests negative for all three.5 Due to its aggressive nature and absence of common breast \ncancer receptors, TNBC is characteristically difficult to treat.5 For patients with metastatic disease with PD -\nL1 expressing tumors, the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy has improved outcomes in the first -\nline setting.10,11 However, for approximately 70% of patients with metastatic TNBC who are not candidates \nfor immunotherapy, chemotherapy remains the first -line standard of care.1,2 \n \nTROP2 is a protein broadly expressed in several solid tumors, including TNBC .12 TROP2 is associated with \nincreased tumor progression and poor survival in patients with breast cancer.13,14 \n \nAbout DATROWAY  \nDATROWAY (datopotamab deruxtecan; datopotamab deruxtecan -dlnk in the U.S. only) is a TROP2 \ndirected ADC. Designed using Daiichi  Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, DATROWAY is one of \nsix DXd ADCs in the oncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanced programs in \nAstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. DATROWAY is comprised of a humanized anti -TROP2 IgG1 \nmonoclonal antibody, developed in collaboration with Sap poro Medical University, attached to a number of \ntopoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n \nDATROWAY (6 mg/kg) is approved in more than 3 5 countries /regions  worldwide for the treatment of ad ult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HR positive, HER2 negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast \ncancer who have received prior endocrine -based therapy and chemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic \ndisease based on the results from the  TROPION -Breast01  trial.\n4 \n  \nDATROWAY  (6 mg/kg)  is approved in Russia and the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic EGFR -mutated non -small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) who have received prior EGFR -\ndirected therapy and platinum -based chemotherapy , based on the results from TROPION -Lung05  and \nTROPION -Lung01  trials. Continued approval for this indication in the U.S. may be contingent upon \nverification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nAbout the DATROWAY Clini cal Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway with more than 20 trials evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of DATROWAY across multiple cancers, including NSCLC , TNBC  and urothelial \ncancer . The program includes eight  phase 3 trials in lung cancer and five phase 3 trials in breast cancer \nevaluating DATROWAY as a monotherapy and in combination with other cancer treatments in various \nsettings.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU® in March 2019  and DATROWAY in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of \nENHERTU and DATROWAY .   \n \nAbout the ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two distinct \nADC technology platforms discovered in -house by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC Technology where each \nADC consists of a monoclon al antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an \nexatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently \nconsists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and DATROWAY, a TROP2 directed ADC, whi ch are being \njointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a \nHER3 directed ADC, ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd), a B7 -H3 directed ADC, and raludotatug deruxtecan \n(R-DXd), a CDH6 directed ADC, are being join tly developed and commercialized globally with Merck & \nCo., Inc, Rahway, NJ, USA. DS -3939, a TA -MUC1 directed ADC, is being developed by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe second Daiichi Sankyo ADC platform consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a modified \npyrro lobenzodiazepine (PBD) payload. DS -9606, a CLDN6 directed PBD ADC, is the first of several \nplanned ADCs in clinical development utilizing this platform.\n5 \n  \nIfinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan, raludotatug deruxtecan, DS -3939 and DS -9606 are \ninvestig ational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy \nhave not been established.  \n \nDATROWAY U.S. Important Safety Information  \nIndication s \nDATROWAY® is a Trop -2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor con jugate indicated for the \ntreatment of:  \n• adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -mutated \nnon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received prior EGFR -directed therapy and platinum -\nbased chemotherapy.  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in the confirmatory trial.  \n \n• adult patients with unresectable or metastatic, hormone receptor (HR) -positive, human epidermal \ngrowth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have \nreceived prior endocrine -based therapy and c hemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease.  \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis  \nDATROWAY can cause severe, life -threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC  \nIn the pooled safety population of 484 patients with NSCLC from TROPION -Lung01, TROPION -Lung05, \nand TROPION -PanTumor01 , ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 7% of patients treated with DATROWAY, \nincluding 0.6% of patients with G rade 3 and 0.4% with Grade 4. There were 8 (1.7%) fatal cases. The \nmedian time to onset for ILD was 1.4 months (range: 0.2 months to 9 months). Eleven patients (2.3%) had \nDATROWAY withheld and 20 patients (4.1%) permanently discontinued DATROWAY due to \nILD/pneumonitis. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 79% (26/33) of patients with ILD/pneumonitis. \nILD/pneumonitis resolved in 45% of patients.  \n \nUnresectable or Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn the pooled safety population of 443 patients with breast cancer from TROPION -Breast01 and TROPION -\nPanTumor01, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 3.6% of patients treated with DATROWAY, including 0.7% of \npatients with Grade 3. There was one fatal case (0.2%). The median time to onset for ILD was 2.8 months \n(range: 1.1 m onths to 10.8 months). Four patients (0.9%) had DATROWAY withheld and 7 patients (1.6%) \npermanently discontinued DATROWAY due to ILD/pneumonitis. Systemic corticosteroids were required in \n60% (9/15) of patients with ILD/pneumonitis.  ILD/pneumonitis resolv ed in 40% of patients.  \n \nPatients were excluded from clinical studies for a history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with \nsteroids or for ongoing ILD/pneumonitis.  \n \nMonitor patients for new or worsening respiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumoniti s (e.g., dyspnea, \ncough, fever) during treatment with DATROWAY. For asymptomatic (Grade 1) ILD/pneumonitis, consider \ncorticosteroid treatment (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic\n6 \n ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment (e.g., ≥1 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual taper for at least \n4 weeks.  \n \nWithhold DATROWAY in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently disco ntinue \nDATROWAY if ≥Grade 2 ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed.  \n \nOcular Adverse Reactions  \nDATROWAY can cause ocular adverse reactions including dry eye, keratitis, blepharitis, meibomian gland \ndysfunction, increased lacrimation, conjunctivitis, and blurred visio n. \n \nIn the pooled safety population, ocular adverse reactions occurred in 36% of patients treated with \nDATROWAY. Twenty patients (2.2%) experienced Grade 3 ocular adverse reactions, which included \nkeratitis, dry eye, and blurred vision, and one patient exp erienced a Grade 4 ocular adverse reaction of \nconjunctival hemorrhage. The most common (≥5%) ocular adverse reactions were dry eye (17%), keratitis \n(14%), and increased lacrimation (7%). The median time to onset for ocular adverse reactions was 2.3 \nmonths (range: 0.03 months to 23.2 months). Of the patients who experienced ocular adverse reactions, 39% \nhad complete resolution, and 10% had partial improvement (defined as a decrease in severity by one or more \ngrades from the worst grade at last follow up). Oc ular adverse reactions led to dosage interruption in 3.6% of \npatients, dosage reductions in 2.5% of patients, and permanent discontinuation of DATROWAY in 1% of \npatients.  \n \nPatients with clinically significant corneal disease were excluded from clinical stu dies. \n \nAdvise patients to use preservative -free lubricant eye drops several times daily for prophylaxis. Advise \npatients to avoid use of contact lenses unless directed by an eye care professional.   \n \nRefer patients to an eye care professional for an ophtha lmic exam including visual acuity testing, slit lamp \nexamination (with fluorescein staining), intraocular pressure, and fundoscopy at treatment initiation, annually \nwhile on treatment, at end of treatment, and as clinically indicated.  \n \nPromptly refer patie nts to an eye care professional for any new or worsening ocular adverse reactions. \nMonitor patients for ocular adverse reactions during treatment with DATROWAY, and if diagnosis is \nconfirmed, withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue DATROWAY b ased on severity . \n \nStomatitis  \nDATROWAY can cause stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis.  \n \nIn the pooled safety population, stomatitis occurred in 63% of patients treated with DATROWAY, including \n8% of patients with Grade 3 events and one patient with a Grade 4 reaction. The median time to first onset of \nstomatitis was 0.5 months (range: 0.03 mo nths to 18.6 months). Stomatitis led to dosage interruption in 6% \nof patients, dosage reductions in 11% of patients, and permanent discontinuation of DATROWAY in 0.5% \nof patients.  \n \nIn patients who received DATROWAY in TROPION -Breast01, 39% used a mouthwas h containing \ncorticosteroid for management or prophylaxis of stomatitis/oral mucositis at any time during the treatment.  \n \nAdvise patients to use a steroid -containing mouthwash for prophylaxis and treatment of stomatitis. Instruct \nthe patient to hold ice ch ips or ice water in the mouth throughout the infusion of DATROWAY.  \n \nMonitor patients for signs and symptoms of stomatitis. If stomatitis occurs, increase the frequency of \nmouthwash and administer other topical treatments as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of the \nadverse reaction, withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue DATROWAY .\n7 \n Embryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nBased on its mechanism of action, DATROWAY can cause embryo -fetal harm when administered to a \npregnant woman because the t opoisomerase inhibitor component of DATROWAY, DXd, is genotoxic and \naffects actively dividing cells.  \n \nAdvise patients of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use \neffective contraception during treatment with DA TROWAY and for 7 months after the last dose. Advise \nmale patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment \nwith DATROWAY and for 4 months after the last dose.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nThe pooled safety popula tion described in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to \nDATROWAY in 927 patients as a single agent at 6 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion once \nevery 3 weeks (21 -day cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. This include d 137 patients \nwith NSCLC in TROPION -Lung05 , 297 patients with NSCLC in TROPION -Lung01, 360 patients with HR -\npositive, HER2 -negative breast cancer in TROPION -Breast01, and 50 patients with NSCLC and 83 patients \nwith breast cancer in TROPION -PanTumor01 (NCT 03401385). Among 927 patients who received \nDATROWAY, 45% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 19% were exposed for greater than one year. \nIn this pooled safety population, the most common (≥20%) adverse reactions were stomatitis (63%), nausea \n(52%), fat igue (45%), alopecia (38%), constipation (28%), decreased appetite (23%), rash (23%), vomiting \n(22%), and musculoskeletal pain (20%). In this pooled safety population, the most common (≥2%) Grade 3 \nor 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased lymphocytes ( 9%) and decreased hemoglobin (3.5%).   \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic EGFR -Mutated Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer  \n \nTROPION -Lung05, TROPION -Lung01, TROPION -PanTumor01  \n \nThe safety of DATROWAY was evaluated in 125 patients with EGFR -mutated NSCLC who received \nDATROWAY 6 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks (21 -day cycle) until \ndisease progression or unacceptable toxicity in TROPION -Lung05 and TROPION -Lung01 as well as \nTROPION -PanTumor01 (NCT03401385). Among these patients, t he median duration of treatment was 6.1 \nmonths (range 0.7 months to 41.7 months).  \n \nThe median age was 63 years (range: 36 to 81), 56% of patients were <65 years, 62% of patients were \nfemale; 66% were Asian, 26% were White, 0.8% were Black, 6% were other ra ces; and 2.4% were of \nHispanic ethnicity.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 26% of patients who received DATROWAY. Serious adverse reactions \nin >1% of patients who received DATROWAY were COVID -19 (4%), stomatitis (2.4%), and pneumonia \n(1.6%). Fatal ad verse reactions occurred in 1.6% of patients who received DATROWAY, due to death not \notherwise specified.  \n \nPermanent discontinuation of DATROWAY due to an adverse reaction occurred in 8% of patients. Adverse \nreactions which resulted in permanent discontinu ation of DATROWAY in >1% of patients included \nILD/pneumonitis (2.4%) and abnormal hepatic function (1.6%).  \n \nDosage interruptions of DATROWAY due to an adverse reaction occurred in 43% of patients.

Adverse reactions \nwhich required dose reduction in >1% of patients included stomatitis (14%), keratitis (1.6%), fatigue (1.6%), \ndecreased weight (1.6%) and COVID -19 (1.6%).\n8 \n  \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were stomatitis (71%), \nnausea (50%), alopecia (49%), fatigue (42%), decreased hemoglobin (34%), decreased lymphocytes (32%), \nconstipation (31%), increased calcium (31% ), increased AST (28%), decreased white blood cell count (27%), \nincreased lactate dehydrogenase (23%), musculoskeletal pain (22%), decreased appetite (20%), increased \nALT (20%), and rash (20%).  \n \nClinically relevant adverse reactions occurring in <10% of patients who received DATROWAY included dry \nskin, blurred vision, abdominal pain, conjunctivitis, dry mouth, ILD/pneumonitis, skin hyperpigmentation, \nincreased lacrimation, and visual impairment.  \n \nUnresectable or Metastatic, HR -Positive, HER2 -Negative Breast Cancer  \n \nTROPION -Breast01  \n \nThe safety of DATROWAY was evaluated in 360 patients with unresectable or metastatic HR -positive, \nHER2 -negative (IHC 0, IHC1+ or IHC2+/ISH -) breast cancer who received at least one dose of \nDATROWAY 6 mg/kg in TROPION -Breast01. DATROWAY was administered by intravenous infusion \nonce every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 6.7 months (range: 0.7 months to 16.1 \nmonths) for patients who received DATROWAY.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 15% of  patients who received DATROWAY. Serious adverse reactions \nin >0.5% of patients who received DATROWAY were urinary tract infection (1.9%), COVID -19 infection \n(1.7%), ILD/pneumonitis (1.1%), acute kidney injury, pulmonary embolism, vomiting, diarrhea, hemip aresis, \nand anemia (0.6% each). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 0.3% of patients who received DATROWAY \nand were due to ILD/pneumonitis.  \n \nPermanent discontinuation of DATROWAY due to an adverse reaction occurred in 3.1% of patients. \nAdverse reactions wh ich resulted in permanent discontinuation of DATROWAY in >0.5% of patients \nincluded ILD/pneumonitis (1.7%) and fatigue (0.6%).  \n \nDosage interruptions of DATROWAY due to an adverse reaction occurred in 22% of patients.

Adverse reactions \nwhich required dose reduction in >1% of patients included stomatitis (13%), fatigue (3.1%), nausea (2.5%), \nand weight decrease (1.9%).  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were stomatitis (59%), \nnausea (56%), fatigue (44%), decreased leukocytes (41%), decreased calcium (39%), alopecia (38%), \ndecreased lymphocytes (36%), decreased hemoglobin (35%), constipation (34%), decreased neutrophils \n(30%), dry  eye (27%), vomiting (24%), increased ALT (24%), keratitis (24%), increased AST (23%), and \nincreased alkaline phosphatase (23%).  \n \nClinically relevant adverse reactions occurring in <10% of patients who received DATROWAY included \ninfusion -related reactions (including bronchospasm), ILD/pneumonitis, headache, pruritus, dry skin, dry \nmouth, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction, blurred vision, increased lacrimation, \nphotophobia, visual impairment, skin hyperpigmentation, and madarosis.  \n \nUse in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy: Based on its mechanism of action, DATROWAY can cause embryo -fetal harm when \nadministered to a pregnant woman because the topoisomerase inhibitor component of DATROWAY,\n9 \n DXd, is genotoxic and affects actively dividing cells. There are no available data on the use of \nDATROWAY in pregnant women to inform a drug -associated risk. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus.  \n• Lactation: There are no data regarding the presence of datopotamab deruxtecan -dlnk or its \nmetabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. \nBecause of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to \nbreastfeed during treatment with DATROWAY and for 1 month  after the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : Pregnancy Testing:  Verify pregnancy status of \nfemales of reproductive potential prior to initiation of DATROWAY . Contraception:  Females:  \nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use eff ective contraception during treatment with \nDATROWAY and for 7 months after the last dose . Males:  Because of the potential for genotoxicity, \nadvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception \nduring treatment with DATROWAY and for 4 months after the last dose . Infertility:  Based on \nfindings in animal toxicity studies, DATROWAY may impair male and female reproductive function \nand fertility. The effects on reproductive organs in animals were irreversible . \n• Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of DATROWAY have not been established in pediatric \npatients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 125 patients with EGFR -mutated NSCLC in TROPION -Lung05, TROPION -\nLung01, TROPION -PanTumor01 treated with DATROWAY 6 mg/kg, 44% were ≥6 5 years of age \nand 10% were ≥75 years of age. No clinically meaningful differences in efficacy and safety were \nobserved between patients ≥65 years of age versus younger patients. Of the 365 patients in \nTROPION -Breast01 treated with DATROWAY 6 mg/kg, 25% we re ≥65 years of age and 5% were \n≥75 years of age. Grade ≥3 and serious adverse reactions were more common in patients ≥65 years \n(42% and 25%, respectively) compared to patients <65 years (33% and 15%, respectively). In \nTROPION -Breast01, no other meaningful  differences in safety or efficacy were observed between \npatients ≥65 years of age versus younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment: A higher incidence of ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with mild \nand moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 30 to <90 mL/min). Monitor patients \nwith renal impairment for increased adverse reactions, including respiratory reactions. No dosage \nadjustment is recommended in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of severe \nrenal impairment  (CLcr <30 mL/min) on the pharmacokinetics of datopotamab deruxtecan -dlnk or \nDXd is unknown.  \n• Hepatic Impairment: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic \nimpairment (total bilirubin ≤ULN and any AST >ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1. 5 times ULN and \nany AST). Limited data are available in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin \n>1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST). Monitor patients with moderate hepatic impairment for \nincreased adverse reactions. The recommended dosage o f DATROWAY has not been established for \npatients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST) . \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA -1088 or fda.gov/ medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, \nand Medication Guide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable deve lopment of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the \nworld.

Data from the trial also  showed an \nearly positive trend  in event -free survival (EFS)  favoring  ENHERTU  followed by THP compared to  ddAC -\nTHP . The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date, the FDA target action date for their regulatory \ndecision, is  May 18, 2026.  \n \nApproximately one in three  patients with early -stage breast cancer are considered high -risk, meaning they are \nmore likely to experience disease recurrence  and have a poor prognosis .1,2 Achieving  pCR in early -stage \nHER2 positive breast cancer , defined as no evidence of invasive cancer cells in the removed breast tissue and \nlymph nodes following treatment, is associated with improved long -term outcomes .3,4 Currently, nearly half \nof patients who receive neoadjuvant treatment do not achieve  pCR, reinforcing the unmet medical need for\n2 \n new treatment options.2,5 The c urrent  standard of care in this neoadjuvant setting varies across regions but \ngenerally consists of combination chemotherapy  regimen s.  \n \n“Achieving a pathologic complete response prior to surgery in HER2 positive early -stage breast cancer  is \ncritical to reducing the risk of disease recurrence  and improving the potential for cure ,” said Ken Takeshita, \nMD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “ If approved, ENHERTU could change how  patients with high -\nrisk HER2 positive early -stage breast cancer are treated and we look forward to working closely with the \nFDA to bring  this innovative treatment regimen to patients in this setting .”  \n \n“The clinically meaningful improvement in pathologic complete response and favorable safety profile seen \nwith DESTINY -Breast11 highlight the opportunity for ENHERTU  followed by THP to become an important \nnew approach for patients with HER2  positive early breast cancer ,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, \nExecutive Vice President, Oncology Hematology R&D, AstraZeneca. “ENHERTU  is already established in \nthe metastatic setting and now we have the potential to expand its use into earlier stages of disease where  \ncure is possible .” \n \nIn DESTINY -Breast11 , ENHERTU followed by THP showed an improved safety profile compared to \nddAC -THP. The safety profiles of ENHERTU and THP were consistent with the known profiles of each \nindividual medicine with no new safety concerns identified. Rates of interstitial lung di sease were similar \nacross the ENHERTU followed by THP and the ddAC -THP arms as determined by an independent \nadjudication committee.  \n \nFollowing a recommendation by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, patient enrollment in a third \narm of DESTINY -Breast11  evaluating ENHERTU alone was closed based on a previous efficacy assessment \nof the study arms .  \n \nENHERTU has demonstrated improved outcomes in six phase 3 breast cancer trials across different subtypes \nand stages of disease, including data from the DESTINY -Breast09  phase 3 trial, which were  recently \npresented  at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (#ASCO25) Annual Meeting  and granted  \nPriority Review in the U.S. , evaluating ENHERTU in the first -line HER2 positive metastatic setting , as well \nas positive topline  results  from a planned interim analysis of the  DESTINY -Breast05  phase 3 trial evaluating  \nENHERTU versus trastuzumab emtansine (T -DM1)  in patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer with \nresidual invasive disease in the breast or axillary lymph nodes after neoadjuvant treatment and high risk of \ndisease recurrence.  Data from  DESTINY -Breast11 (Abstract #291O ) and DESTINY -Breast05 (Abstract \n#LBA1) will be presented during  Presidential Symposium I  on Saturday, October 18 at the upcoming 2025 \nEuropean Society for Medical Oncology (#ESMO25) Congress.\n3 \n  \n \nAbout  DESTINY -Breast11  \nDESTINY -Breast11  is a global,  multicenter,  randomized,  open -label,  phase  3 trial evaluating  the efficacy  \nand safety  of neoadjuvant  ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg)  monotherapy  or ENHERTU  followed  by THP  (paclitaxel,  \ntrastuzumab  and pertuzumab)  versus  ddAC -THP  in patients  with high-risk (lymph  node  positive  [N1-3] or \nprimary  tumor  stage  T3-4), locally  advanced  or inflammatory  HER2  positive  early -stage  breast  cancer.   \n \nPatients  were  randomized  1:1:1  to receive  either  eight  cycles  of ENHERTU  monotherapy;  four cycles  of \nENHERTU  followed  by four cycles  of THP;  or four cycles  of ddAC  (dose -dense  doxorubicin  and \ncyclophosphamide)  followed  by four cycles  of THP.   \n \nThe primary  endpoint  of DESTINY -Breast11  is rate of pCR (absence  of invasive  disease  in the breast  and \nlymph  nodes).  Secondary  endpoints  include  EFS, invasive  disease -free survival,  overall  survival  and safety.  \n \nDESTINY -Breast11  enrolled  927 patients  across  multiple  sites in Asia,  Europe,  North  America  and South  \nAmerica.  For more  information  about  the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Early Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.6 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022, with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally.6 In the U.S. , more than 300 ,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually  with more \nthan 42,000 deaths .7 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers.8 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a \nresult of HER2 gene amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in \nbreast cancer.9 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.10  \n \nApproximately one in three patients with early -stage breast cancer are considered high -risk, as they are more \nlikely to experience disease recurrence and have a poor prognosis.1,2 Achieving  pCR in early -stage HER2 \npositive breast cancer is associated with improved long -term outcomes.3,4 The current standard of care in \nmany regions of the world in this neoadjuvant setting consists of combination chemotherapy regimens. These \nregimens may include anthracyclines, which can be challenging for patients to tolerate and may result in \nlong-term cardiotoxicity . Further, nearly half of patients who receive neoadjuvant treatment do not achieve  \npCR, reinforcing the need for new treatment options .2,5\n4 \n  \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most adva nced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n  \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 85 countries /regions  worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or in -situ \nhybridization (ISH)+) breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the \nmetastatic setting o r in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or \nwithin six months of completing therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n  \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 85 countries /regions  worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have \nreceived a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within \nsix months of  completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n  \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than  45 countries /regions  worldwide for  the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/  \nISH-) or HER2 ultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by a locally or \nregionally approved test, that has progressed on one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting \nbased on the results from the DESTINY -Breast06  trial. \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 60 countries /regions  worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2 ) mutations, as \ndetected by a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on \nthe results from the DESTINY -Lung02  and/or DESTINY -Lung05  trials. Continued approval in China and \nthe U.S. for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a \nconfirmatory trial.  \n  \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 70 countries /regions  worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) gastric or \ngastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen \nbased on the results from  the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric02  and/or DESTINY -Gastric06  trials.\n5 \n Continued approval in China for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n  \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 10 countries /regions  worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior \nsystemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options based on efficacy results from the \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 , DESTINY -Lung01  and DESTINY -CRC02  trials. Continued approval for this \nindication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU as a monotherapy or in combination or sequentially with other cancer medicines  across multiple \nHER2 targetable cancers.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019  and DATROWAY® in July 2020 , except  in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of \nENHERTU and DATROWA Y. \n \nAbout  the ADC  Portfolio  of Daiichi  Sankyo   \nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two distinct \nADC technology platforms discovered in -house by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n  \nThe ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC Technology where each \nADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an \nexatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleava ble linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently \nconsists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and DATROWAY, a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being \njointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a \nHER3 directed ADC , ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd), a B7 -H3 directed ADC, and raludotatug deruxtecan \n(R-DXd), a CDH6 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with Merck & \nCo., Inc, Rahway, NJ, USA. DS -3939, a TA -MUC1 directed ADC, is being develo ped by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe second Daiichi Sankyo ADC platform consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a modified \npyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) payload. DS -9606, a CLDN6 directed PBD ADC, is the first of several \nplanned ADCs in clinical development utilizing this platform.\n6 \n   \nIfinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan , raludotatug deruxtecan, DS -3939 and DS -9606 are \ninvestigational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy \nhave not been established.  \n \nENHERTU U.S. Important Safety Information  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC 3+ or ISH positive) breast cancer who have received \na prior anti -HER2 -based regimen either:  \n– In the metastatic setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six  \nmonths of completing therapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic:  \n– Hormone receptor (HR) -positive, HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 -ultralow (IHC 0 \nwith membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -approved test, that has progressed \non one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting  \n– HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -approved test, who \nhave received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during \nor within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 \n(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA -approved test, and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration \nof response.

Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and \ndescription of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, \ndyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue \nENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk \nand to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of \nthese risks and the need for effective contraception.\n7 \n  \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life -threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Cons ider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose 1 level . Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (range: \n0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonit is occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with \nENHERTU.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: \n1.2 to 21).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Co unt [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level. For febrile neutropenia ( ANC <1.0 \nx 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Nineteen percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time t o first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 \ndays (range: 2 to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.2% of patients.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty -one percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Media n time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 \ndays (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.\n8 \n  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is 20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. \nIf LVEF of 20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \npatients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHER TU has not been studied in \npatients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 4.6% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3 or 4.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive poten tial to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after th e last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until  \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer , HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \n2233 patients in Study DS8201 -A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast02, \nDESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -Breast04, DESTINY -Breast06, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY -Lung02, \nDESTINY -CRC02, and DESTINY -PanTumor02.

Advise patients \nof the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant \nwomen, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions \nin a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during tre atment with ENHERTU and for 7 months \nafter the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing : Verify pregnancy status of females \nof reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : ENHERTU can \ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to \nuse effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 1741 patients with HER2 -positive, HER2 -low, or HER2 -ultralow breast cancer \ntreated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 24% were ≥65 years and 4.9% were ≥75 years. No overall \ndifferences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 year s of age compared \nto younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients \naged ≥65 years (61%) as compared to younger patients (52%). Of the 101 patients with HER2 -mutant \nunresectable or metastat ic NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% \nwere ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of \nage compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with HER2 -positive locally adv anced or \nmetastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, \n56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed \nbetween patients ≥65 years of age compared to young er patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2 -positive \n(IHC 3+) unresectable or metastatic solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -\nPanTumor02, DESTINY -Lung01, or DESTINY -CRC02, 39% were ≥65 years and 9% were ≥75 years. \nNo overall differences in  efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared \nto younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA -1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide .\n13 \n  \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the \nworld.

This is the second positive p hase 3 trial of ENHERTU in the HER2  positive early \nbreast cancer setting following positive results from the DESTINY -Breast11  phase 3 neoadjuvant trial earlier \nthis year.  \n \nOverall survival (OS) was not mature at the time of this planned interim analysis  and will be assessed at a \nsubsequent analysis.   \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and being jointly developed and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN).   \n Currently, a pproximately half  of patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer have residual disease \nfollowing neoadjuvant treatment , putting them at an increased risk of disease recurrence.\n1-7 Despite receiving \nadditional treatment in the post -neoadjuvant setting, some patients still ultimately experience tumor \nprogression to metastatic disease . 8,9 New treatment options are needed in the early breast cancer setting to  \nhelp reduce the likelihood of disease progression and improve long- term outcomes  for more patients .10,11\n2 \n  \n“In patients with early breast cancer with residual disease following neoadjuvant treatment, it is critical to \noptimize  treatment as this  represents the last opportunity to prevent progression to metastatic disease ,” said \nKen Takeshita, MD, Global Head , R&D , Daiichi Sankyo. “The results of DESTINY -Breast05 demonstrate  \nthat treatment with ENHERTU following surgery increases  the length of time patients are able to live free of \ninvasive disease compared to the existing standard of care , potentially  offer ing patients with HER2 positive \nearly breast cancer a  new treatment approach  in this curative -intent setting .”  \n “This landmark trial is the first to directly compare ENHERTU  and T -DM1 in early breast cancer  and the \nresults clearly show that E NHERTU delivers superior outcomes, indicating that it may be a better option for \npatients with hig h risk HER2  positive early breast cancer  in the post -neoadjuvant setting ,” said Susan \nGalbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology Hematology R&D , AstraZeneca. “ These \nresults from DESTINY -Breast05,  coupled with DESTINY- Breast11,  underscore our commitment to mov ing \nENHERTU  into early -stage  HER2  positive breast cancer  where patients can achieve sustained long- term \noutcomes , increasing the opportunity for cure.”  \n The safety profile of ENHERTU observed in DESTINY -Breast05 was consistent with its known profile with \nno new safety concerns identified .  \n Data from DESTINY -Breast 05 (Abstract #LBA1)  and DESTINY -Breast11  (Abstract #291O ) will be \npresented during Presidential Symposium I  on Saturday, October 18 at the upcoming 2025 European Society \nfor Medical  Oncology (#ESMO25)  Congress . The DESTINY -Breast05 data also will be  shared with  global \nregulatory authorities.  \n DESTINY -Breast05 was  conducted in collaboration with the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel \nProject Foundation (NSABP), the German Breast Group (GBG), Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynäkologische Onkologie (AGO -B) and SOLTI Breast Cancer Research Group.  \n \nAbout  DESTINY- Breast 05 \nDESTINY -Breast05\n is a global, multicenter, randomized, open- label, phase  3 trial evaluating the efficacy  \nand safety  of ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg)  versus  T-DM1  in patients with  HER2  positive  primary  breast  cancer  \nwith residual  invasive  disease in  breast  or axillary  lymph  nodes  following  neoadjuvant  therapy and a  high  \nrisk of recurrence . High risk of recurrence  was defined as presentation with  inoperable cancer (prior to \nneoadjuvant therapy) or pathologically positive axillary lymph nodes following neoadjuvant therapy.\n3 \n The primary  endpoint  of DESTINY -Breast05  is investigator -assessed  IDFS . IDFS  is defined as the time from  \nrandomization  until  first recurrence,  distant  recurrence or  death  from  any cause.  The key secondary  endpoint  \nis investigator -assessed  disease- free survival . Other  secondary endpoints  include  OS, distant recurrence- free \ninterval, brain  metastas es-free interval  and safety.   \n \nDESTINY -Breast05  enrolled  1,635 patients in Asia,  Europe, North  America , Oceania  and South  America.  \nFor more  information  about  the trial, visit  ClinicalTrials.gov.  \n \nAbout HER2 Positive  Early Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.12 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022, with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally.12 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast cancer.13 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a result of HER2 gene \namplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in breast cancer.14 \nApproximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.15  \n \nCurrently, a pproximately half of patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer have residual disease \nfollowing neoadjuvant treatment , putting them at an increased risk of disease recurrence.1-7 Despite receiving \nadditional treatment in the post -neoadjuvant setting, some patients still ultimately  experience tumor \nprogression to metastatic disease .8,9 Once patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease, the five- year \nsurvival rate drops from nearly 90 % to approximately 30%.16 New treatment options are needed in the early \nbreast cancer setting to  help reduce the likelihood of disease progression and  improve long- term outcomes \nfor more patients .10,11  \n About ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most adva nced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n  ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 85 countries /regions  worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or in -situ \nhybridization (ISH)+) breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the\n4 \n metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or \nwithin six months of completing therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n  ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 85 countries/regions  worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have \nreceived a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within \nsix months o f completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n  \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 45 countries/regions  worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+  / \nISH-) or HER2 ultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by a locally or \nregionally approved test, that has progressed on one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast06  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 60 countries/regions  worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2 ( ERBB2 ) mutations, as \ndetected by a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on \nthe results from the DESTINY -Lung02 and/or DESTINY -Lung05 trials. Continued approval in China and \nthe U.S. for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a \nconfirmatory trial.  \n  \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 70 countries/regions  worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) gastric or \ngastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab- based regimen \nbased on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric02  and/or DESTINY -Gastric06  trials. \nContinued approval in China for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n  \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 10 countries/regions  worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options based on efficacy results from the \nDESTINY -PanTumor02, DESTINY -Lung01 and DESTINY -CRC02  trials. Continued approval for this \nindication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\n5 \n  \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU as a monotherapy or in combination or sequentially with other cancer medicines across multiple HER2 targetable cancers.  \n About the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019 and DATROWAY\n® in July 2020, except  in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of \nENHERTU and DATROWAY.  About  the ADC Portfolio  of Daiichi  Sankyo   \nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two distinct ADC technology platforms discovered in-house by Daiichi Sankyo.  The ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC Technology where each \nADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an \nexatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide- based cleavable linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently \nconsists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and DATROWAY, a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a \nHER3 directed ADC , ifinatamab deruxtecan (I- DXd), a B7 -H3 directed ADC, and raludotatug deruxtecan \n(R-DXd), a CDH6 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with Merck & \nCo., Inc, Rahway, NJ, USA. DS-3939, a TA- MUC1 directed ADC, is being develo ped by Daiichi Sankyo. \n The second Daiichi Sankyo ADC platform consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a modified \npyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) payload. DS- 9606, a CLDN6 directed PBD ADC, is the first of several \nplanned ADCs in clinical development utilizing this platform.  \n  \nIfinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan , raludotatug deruxtecan, DS- 3939 and DS -9606 are \ninvestigational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country.

Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and \ndescription of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY  \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue \nENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of \nthese risks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \nWarnings and Precautions \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Cons ider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days\n7 \n from date of onset, reduce dose 1 level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Pro mptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks. \n HER2 -Positive, HER2- Low, and HER2- Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (range: 0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonit is occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with \nENHERTU.  \n HER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: \n1.2 to 21). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 10\n9/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level. For febrile neutropenia ( ANC <1.0 \nx 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \nHER2 -Positive, HER2- Low, and HER2- Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Nineteen percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time t o first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 \ndays (range: 2 to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.2% of patients. \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty- one percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 \ndays (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients. \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is 20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. \nIf LVEF of 20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \npatients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHER TU has not been studied in \npatients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n HER2 -Positive, HER2- Low, and HER2- Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 4.6% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3 or 4.\n8 \n  \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive poten tial to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after th e last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until  \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nHER2 -Positive, HER2- Low, and HER2- Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \n2233 patients in Study DS8201-A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY- Breast01, DESTINY -Breast02, \nDESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -Breast04, DESTINY -Breast06, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY -Lung02, \nDESTINY -CRC02, and DESTINY- PanTumor02.

Advise patients \nof the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant \nwomen, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during tre atment with ENHERTU and for 7 months \nafter the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females \nof reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can \ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to \nuse effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.\n12 \n • Geriatric Use: Of the 1741 patients with HER2- positive, HER2- low, or HER2- ultralow breast cancer \ntreated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 24% were ≥65 years and 4.9% were ≥75 years. No overall \ndifferences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 year s of age compared \nto younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients \naged ≥65 years (61%) as compared to younger patients (52%).

No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with HER2- positive locally advanced or \nmetastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, \n56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed \nbetween patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2- positive \n(IHC 3+) unresectable or metastatic solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -\nPanTumor02, DESTINY -Lung01, or DESTINY -CRC02, 39% were ≥65 years and 9% were ≥75 years. \nNo overall differences in  efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared \nto younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of society that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the world.

The Priority Review \nfollows receipt of  Breakthrough Therapy Designation  granted  by the FDA for ENHERTU  plus pertuzumab  \nbased on data from the DESTINY -Breast09  phase 3 trial  in July 2025 . The Prescription Drug User Fee Act \n(PDUFA) date, the FDA target action date for their regulatory decision, is  January 23, 2026 . \n \nThe sBLA is being reviewed under the Real -Time Oncology Review (RTOR) program, an initiative of the \nFDA designed to bring safe and effective cancer treatments to patients as early as possible. RTOR allows the \nFDA to review components of an application befo re submission of the complete application.  \n \nThe sBLA is based on data from DESTINY -Breast09  presented  as a special late-breaking oral session at the  \n2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (#ASCO25) Annual Meeting . In the trial , ENHERTU in \ncombination with pertuzumab reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 44% versus taxane, \ntrastuzumab and pertuzumab (THP) (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44 -0.71;\n2 \n p<0.00001)  as a first -line treatment for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer. Median \nprogression -free survival ( PFS) was 40.7 months (95% CI: 36.5 -NC) with ENHERTU plus pertuzumab \ncompared to 26.9 months (95% CI: 21.8 -NC) for THP as assessed by blinded independent central review \n(BICR). The PFS benefit for  ENHERTU  plus pertuzumab versus THP was consistent across subgroups . \n \nConfirmed objective response rate (ORR) with ENHERTU plus pertuzumab was 85.1% (95% CI: 81.2-88.5) \nversus 78.6% (95% CI: 74.1-82.5) with THP. There were  58 complete responses (CR) and 268 partial \nresponses (PR)  with ENHERTU plus pertuzumab compared to 33 CRs and 271 PRs with THP. Median \nduration of response (DOR) for ENHERTU plus pertuzumab exceeded three years (39.2 months) versus 26.4 \nmonths with THP.  \n \n“ENHERTU in combination with pertuzumab delayed disease progression for more than three years \ncompared to around two years with current standard of care  as a first -line treatment for patients with HER2 \npositive metastatic  breast cancer ,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “ Receiving \nPriority Review  moves  us closer to  offering  ENHERTU to patients even earlier in the metastatic treatment \npathway as a potential new first -line treatment option .”  \n \n“The DESTINY -Breast09  trial showed that treating patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer \nwith ENHERTU in combination with pertuzumab until progression in the first -line setting produced a new \nlandmark of more than 40 months for progression -free survival and nearly doubled  the number of patients \nwith no evidence of disease on imaging ,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, \nOncology Hematology R&D, AstraZeneca. “This marks the first major evolution in treatment in this first -\nline setting in more than a decade  – a setting where a strong response is crucial, as up to one third of patients \nmay not receive second -line therapy.”   \n \nThe safety profile of ENHERTU plus pertuzumab in DESTINY -Breast09 was consistent with the known \nprofiles of each individual therapy with no new safety concerns identified. Grade 3 or higher treatment \nemergent  adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 54.9% of patients in the ENHERTU plus pertuzumab arm and \n52.4% of patients in the THP arm. The most common grade 3 or higher TEAEs occurring in 5% or more of \npatients treated with ENHERTU plus pertuzumab were neutropenia  (23.9%), hypokalemia (10.2%), anemia \n(8.4%), fa tigue (7.9%), diarrhea (6.8%) , thrombocytopenia (6.3%) and nausea (5.0%). Interstitial lung \ndisease (ILD) or pneumonitis events occurred in 12.1% of patients treated with ENHERTU plus pertuzumab \nas determined by an independent adjudication committee. The majority of ILD or pneumonitis e vents were \nlow grade (grade 1 [n=17; 4.5%] or grade 2 [n=27; 7.1%]). There were two grade 5 ILD events (0.5%) in the \nENHERTU plus pertuzumab arm.\n3 \n ENHERTU  is already approved in more than 85 countries /regions  worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or in -situ \nhybridization (ISH)+) breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the \nmetastatic setting o r in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or \nwithin six months of completing therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n \nAbout  DESTINY -Breast09   \nDESTINY -Breast09  is a global, multicenter, randomized, open -label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy \nand safety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) either alone or in combination with pertuzumab versus standard of care \nTHP as a first -line treatment in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer .  \n \nPatients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either ENHERTU monotherapy with a pertuzumab matching \nplacebo; ENHERTU in combination with pertuzumab; or THP.  Randomization was stratified by prior \ntreatment ( de novo  metastatic disease versus progression from early -stage disease), hormone recept or (HR) \nstatus and PIK3CA  mutation status.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY -Breast09 is PFS as assessed by BICR  in both the ENHERTU \nmonotherapy and ENHERTU combination arms. Secondary endpoints include investigator -assessed PFS, \noverall survival, ORR , DOR , pharmacokinetics and safety. The investigational arm assessing ENHERTU  \nmonotherapy versus THP remains blinded to patients and investigators and will continue to the final PFS \nanalysis.  \n \nDESTINY -Breast09 enrolled  1,157 patients across  multiple  sites in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and \nSouth America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov .  \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.1 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022, with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally.1 In the U.S. , more than 300 ,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually  with more \nthan 42,000  deaths .2 While survival rates are high for those diagnosed with early breast cancer, only about \n30% of patients diagnosed with or progress to metastatic disease are expected to live five years following \ndiagnosis.3  \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast cancer.4 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a result of HER2  gene \namplification.5 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.6\n4 \n HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer is an aggressive disease driven by overexpression or amplification of \nHER2 that affects 15% to 20% of patients with metastatic breast cancer.7 Approximately 10,000 patients are \ntreated each year in the first -line HER2 positive metastatic setting in the U.S.8 While HER2 targeted \ntherapies have improved outcomes, prognosis remains poor with most patients experiencing disease \nprogression within two years of first -line treatment with THP, which has been the standard of care for more \nthan a decade.5,9,10,11 Further, approximately 25% to 30%  of patients do not receive  any treatment following \nfirst-line therapy due to discontinuation  or death .12,13,14 \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd  ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor pa yloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 85 countries /regions  worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or in -situ \nhybridization (ISH)+) breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the \nmetastatic setting o r in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or \nwithin six months of completing therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 85 countries /regions  worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have \nreceived a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within \nsix months o f completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 4 5 countries /regions  for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 \nultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by a locally or regionally approved \ntest, tha t have progressed on one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Breast06  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 60 countries /regions  worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2 ) mutations, as \ndetected by a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on \nthe results from the DESTINY -Lung02  and/or DESTINY -Lung05  trials.  Continued approval in China and\n5 \n the U.S. for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a \nconfirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 70 countries /regions  worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) gastric or \ngastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen \nbased on the results from  the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric02  and/or DESTINY -Gastric06  trials. \nContinued approval in China for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 10 countries /regions  worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior \nsystemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options based on efficacy results from the \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 , DESTINY -Lung01  and DESTINY -CRC02  trials. Continued approval for this \nindication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU as a monotherapy or in combination or sequentially with other cancer medicines  across multiple \nHER2 targetable cancers.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU  in March 2019  and DATROWAY® in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of \nENHERTU  and DATROWAY.  \n \nAbout  the ADC  Portfolio  of Daiichi  Sankyo   \nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two distinct \nADC technology platforms discovered in -house by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n  \nThe ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC Technology where each \nADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an \nexatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleava ble linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently \nconsists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and DATROWAY, a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being \njointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a \nHER3 directed ADC , ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd), a B7 -H3 directed ADC, and raludotatug deruxtecan\n6 \n (R-DXd), a CDH6 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with Merck & \nCo., Inc, Rahway, NJ, USA. DS -3939, a TA -MUC1 directed ADC, is being developed by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe second Daiichi Sankyo ADC platform consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a modified \npyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) payload. DS -9606, a CLDN6 directed PBD ADC, is the first of several \nplanned ADCs in clinical development utilizing this platform.  \n  \nIfinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan , raludotatug deruxtecan, DS -3939 and DS -9606 are \ninvestigational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy \nhave not been established.  \n \nENHERTU U.S. Important Safety Information  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC 3+ or ISH positive) breast cancer who have received \na prior anti -HER2 -based regimen either:  \n– In the metastatic setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six  \nmonths of completing therapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic:  \n– Hormone receptor (HR) -positive, HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 -ultralow (IHC 0 \nwith membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -approved test, that has progressed \non one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting  \n– HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -approved test, who \nhave received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during \nor within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 \n(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA -approved test, and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration \nof response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and \ndescription of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH positive) gastric or \ngastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based \nregimen  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic \ntreatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration \nof response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and \ndescription of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\n7 \n  \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, \ndyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue \nENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk \nand to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of \nthese risks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life -threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Cons ider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose 1 level . Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (range: \n0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonit is occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with \nENHERTU.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: \n1.2 to 21).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Co unt [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level. For febrile neutropenia ( ANC <1.0 \nx 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Nineteen percent had\n8 \n Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 \ndays (range: 2 to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.2% of patients.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty -one percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Media n time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 \ndays (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is 20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. \nIf LVEF of 20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \npatients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHER TU has not been studied in \npatients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 4.6% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3 or 4.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive poten tial to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after th e last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until  \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer , HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \n2233 patients in Study DS8201 -A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast02, \nDESTINYBreast03, DESTINY -Breast04, DESTINY -Breast06, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY -Lung02, \nDESTINY -CRC02, and DESTINY -PanTumor02. Among these patients, 67% were exposed for >6 months \nand 38% were exposed for >1 year. In this pooled safety population, the most common (≥20%) adverse \nreactions, including laboratory abnormalities, we re decreased white blood cell count (73%), nausea (72%), \ndecreased hemoglobin (67%), decreased neutrophil count (65%), decreased lymphocyte count (60%), fatigue \n(55%), decreased platelet count (48%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (46%), increased al anine\n9 \n aminotransferase (44%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (39%), vomiting (38%), alopecia (37%), \nconstipation (32%), decreased blood potassium (32%), decreased appetite (31%), diarrhea (30%), and \nmusculoskeletal pain (24%).  \n \nHER2 -Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nDESTINY -Breast03  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 257 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast \ncancer who received at least 1 dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks in \nDESTINY -Breast03. The median duration of treatment was 14 months (range: 0.7 to 30) for patients who \nreceived ENHERTU.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 19% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were vomiting, ILD, pneumonia, pyrexia, and urinary tract \ninfection. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients including COVID -19 and sudden \ndeath (1 patient each).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 14% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis accounted for 8%. \nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients treated with ENHERTU.

Advise patients \nof the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant \nwomen, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions \nin a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during tre atment with ENHERTU and for 7 months \nafter the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing : Verify pregnancy status of females \nof reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : ENHERTU can \ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to \nuse effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 1741 patients with HER2 -positive, HER2 -low, or HER2 -ultralow breast cancer \ntreated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 24% were ≥65 years and 4.9% were ≥75 years. No overall \ndifferences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 year s of age compared \nto younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients \naged ≥65 years (61%) as compared to younger patients (52%). Of the 101 patients with HER2 -mutant \nunresectable or metastat ic NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% \nwere ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of \nage compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with HER2 -positive locally adv anced or \nmetastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, \n56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed \nbetween patients ≥65 years of age compared to young er patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2 -positive \n(IHC 3+) unresectable or metastatic solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -\nPanTumor02, DESTINY -Lung01, or DESTINY -CRC02, 39% were ≥65 years and 9% were ≥75 years. \nNo overall differences in  efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared \nto younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min) . \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA -1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide .\n13 \n About Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the \nworld.

    "content": "1 \n  \n \n Press Release\n \n \nENHERTU® Type II Variation Application Validated in the EU  for \nPreviously Treated Patients with  HER2 Positive  Metastatic Solid \nTumors  \n• Submission based on three  phase 2 trials  where  Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s ENHERTU showed \nclinically meaningful responses across a broad range of tumors  \n• If approved, ENHERTU would become the first HER2 directed medicine  and antibody drug conjugate to \nreceive a tumor agnostic indication in the EU  \nTokyo and Munich  – (September 11, 2025)  – The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated the \nType II Variation marketing authorization application for ENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan) for the \ntreatment of adult patients with  HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+) unresectable or metastatic \nsolid tumors who have received prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by \nDaiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and being jointly developed and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN).  \n The v alidation confirms the completion of the application and commences the scientific review process by \nthe EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. The application is based on data from three \nphase 2 trials including DESTINY-PanTumor02, DESTINY- CRC02  and DESTINY -Lung01 where \nENHERTU demonstrated clinically meaningful responses across a broad range of tumors.  \n “ENHERTU has shown a clinically meaningful benefit across several studies in HER2 positive metastatic \nsolid cancers and this validation by the EMA is an important first step toward bringing this medicine to these \npatients in the EU ,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “ We look forward to \nworking with the EMA to potentially secure a tumor agnostic indicat ion for ENHERTU  in the EU , similar t o \nseveral other regions of the world where this approval  has been received .”  \n \nAbout DESTINY-PanTumor02  \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 is a global, multicenter, multi -cohort, open- label phase 2 trial evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) for the treatment of previously treated HER2 expressing \ntumors, including biliary tract, bladder, cervical, endometrial, ovarian, pa ncreatic cancer or other tumors.\n2 \n  \nThe primary efficacy endpoint of DESTINY -PanTumor02 is confirmed objective response rate (ORR)  as \nassessed by investigator. Secondary endpoints include  duration of response  (DOR ), disease control rate \n(DCR ), progression- free survival  (PFS) , overall survival  (OS), safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics. \nResults from  DESTINY -PanTumor02 were  published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology . \n \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 enrolled 267 patients , including 111 HER2 positive (IHC 3+) adult patients , at \nmultiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America. For more information about the trial, visit \nClinicalTrials.gov . \n About DESTINY- Lung01  \nDESTINY -Lung01 is  a global phase 2, open- label, two -cohort trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg and 5.4 mg/kg) in patients with HER2  mutant (cohort 2, n=91) or HER2 \noverexpressing (defined as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+) (cohort 1 and 1a, n=90) unresectable or metastatic  non- small  \ncell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) who had progressed after one or more systemic therapies.  \n The primary endpoint is confirmed ORR by independent central review. Key secondary endpoints include \nDOR, DCR, PFS, OS and safety. Results  from the HER2 mutant cohort were published in The New England \nJournal of Medicine  and results from the HER2 overexpressing cohort were published in The Lancet \nOncology . \n \nDESTINY -Lung01 enrolled 181 patients , including 17 HER2 positive (IHC 3+) adult patients , at multiple \nsites in Asia, Europe and North America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.  \n \nAbout DESTINY- CRC02  \nDESTINY -CRC02  is a global, randomized, two arm, parallel, multicenter phase 2 trial evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of two doses (5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg) of ENHERTU in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/  in situ hybridization  (ISH)+) colorectal cancer \nof BRAF wild -type, RAS wild- type or RAS mutant tumor types previously treated with standard therapy. \nThe trial was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, patients (n=80) were randomized 1:1 to receive \neither 5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg of ENHERTU. In the second stage, additional patients (n=42) were enrolled in \nthe 5.4 mg/kg arm.  \n The primary endpoint is confirmed ORR as assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints include DOR, DCR, investigator -assessed confirmed ORR, clinical benefit ratio, PFS, OS and \nsafety. R esults from DESTINY -CRC02  were  published  in The Lancet Oncology .\n3 \n DESTINY -CRC02 enrolled 122 patients, including 64 HER2 positive (IHC 3+) adult patients, at multiple \nsites in Asia, Europe and North America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout HER2 Expression in Solid Tumors   \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of various tissue cells \nthroughout the body and is involved in normal cell growth.1 In some cancers, the HER2  gene is  amplified or \nthe cells  have activating mutations .2 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a result of HER2 gene \namplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis.3  \n \nIn the EU, HER2 directed therapies have been used to treat breast,  gastric and lung  cancers. Although HER2 \nis expressed in solid tumor types including biliary tract, bladder, cervical, endometrial, ovarian and \npancreatic cancers, testing is not routinely performed in these additional tumor types and as a result, \navailable literature is limited.2 In these solid tumors, HER2 overexpression, classified as IHC 3+, has been \nobserved at rates from 1% up to 31 %.4,5,6 Approximately 1% to 5% of patients with NSCLC have tumors \nwith HER2 overexpression (IHC 3+).4,7 In metastatic colorectal cancer, an estimated  2% to 4% of patients \nhave tumors that are HER2 overexpressing (IHC 3+).8,9 HER2 positive expression (IHC 3+)  has been \nreported in  approximately 4% to 28% of  endometrial cancers and 1% to 5% of ovarian cancers.5,10,11,12,13   \n About ENHERTU  ENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam- trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most adva nced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform.

Further,  patients  must have  \nexperienced disease progression on first-line endocrine  and CDK4 /6 inhibitor therapy  in the advanced \nor metastatic setting  or relapse  on or within 24 months of adjuvant endocrine and CDK4/6 inhibitor \ntherapy . \n \nPatients will be randomized 1:1 to receive patritumab deruxtecan or physician’s choice of treatment, \nconsisting of either chemotherapy (paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, capecitabine, liposomal doxorubicin ) or \nHER2 directed ADC  (trastuzumab deruxtecan ). Randomization will be stratified by HER2 expression \nand treatment intent  (chemotherapy versus trastuzumab deruxtecan) , HER3 expression (low versus \nhigh per IHC ) and presence of visceral disease.  \n \nThe dual primary endpoints of HERTHENA -Breast04  are progression -free survival  by blinded \nindependent central review and overall survival . Secondary endpoints include objective response rate, \nduration of response and safety . \n \nHERTHENA -Breast04  will enroll approximately 1,000 patients  across Asia, Europe , North America , \nand South America . For more information, please visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout  Hormone Receptor  Positive , HER 2 Negative Breast Cancer  \nMore than 2 million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2022 , with approximately 670,000 \ndeaths globally .3 While survival rates are high for those diagnosed with early -stage  breast cancer, only \nabout 30% of patients initially diagnosed with advanced disease or having metastatic progression are \nexpected to live five years following diagnosis.1\n3 \n Approximately  70% of diagnosed  cases  are considered what has been historically called  HR positive,  \nHER2 negative breast cancer  (as measured as HER2 score of IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC  2+/ISH -).4,5  \nPatients with HR positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer experience poor outcomes if they \nprogress following initial treatment, highlighting the need for additional options.2  \n \nAbout HER3   \nHER3 is a member of the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases.6 HER3 is broadly  expressed in \nabout 90% of breast tumors.7,8,9 HER3 is associated with poor treatment outcomes, including shorter \nrelapse -free survival and significantly reduced survival.10,11  There is currently no HER3  directed \ntherapy approved for the treatment of any cancer.  \n \nAbout Patritumab Deruxtecan  \nPatritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd) is an investigational HER3  directed ADC. Designed using \nDaiichi Sankyo’ s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, patritumab deruxtecan is composed of a fully \nhuman anti -HER3 IgG1 monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor  \npayloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n \nAbout the Patritumab Deruxtecan Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety \nof patritumab deruxtecan across multiple cancers.

Median progression -free survival (PFS) was 13.2 months (95% CI: 11.4 -\n15.2) in the ENHERTU arm compared to 8.1 months (95% CI: 7.0 -9.0) in the chemotherapy arm. In the \nHER2 ultralow popula tion (n=152; HR 0.78; 95% CI: 0.50 -1.21) the median PFS was 13.2 months (95% CI: \n9.8-17.3) in patients treated with ENHERTU compared to 8.3 months (95% CI: 5.8 -15.2) in those treated \nwith chemotherapy.\n2 \n “ENHERTU continues to  transform the way breast cancer is treated, becoming the first HER2 directed \nmedicine  approved in  Japan  for patients  with HR positive , HER2 low or HER2 ultralow metastatic breast \ncancer,” said Yuki Abe, PhD, Head of R&D Division in Japan and Head of Research, Daiichi Sankyo . “This  \napproval , which is the fifth indication for ENHERTU in Japan  in five years , bring s this important medicine \nto an earlier treatment setting and a broader  patient population with  lower levels of  HER2 expression .”  \n \nIn DESTINY -Breast06, the safety profile of ENHERTU was consistent with previous clinical trials with no \nnew safety concerns identified.  Treatment -emergent  adverse events ( TEAEs) occurred in 417 patients \n(96.1% ) treated with ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) , including 35 J apanese patients . The most common TEAEs \nwere nausea (65.9%), fatigue (46.8%), alopecia (45.4%), decreased neutrophil count (37.6%), increased \ntransaminase (29.5%), anemia (28.1%) and vomiting (27.2%). Interstitial lung disease (ILD) occurred in \n20.0% of Ja panese patients treated with ENHERTU as determined by an independent ILD adjudication \ncommittee.  \n \nENHERTU is approved in Japan with a Warning for ILD. As cases of ILD, including fatal cases, have \noccurred in ENHERTU -treated patients, ENHERTU is to be used in close collaboration with a respiratory \ndisease expert. Patients should be closely observed during therapy by monitoring for early signs or symptoms \nof ILD (such as dyspnea, cough or fever) and performing regular peripheral artery oxygen saturation (SpO 2) \ntests, chest X -ray scans and chest CT scans. If abnormalities are observed, discontinue administration of \nENHERTU and take appropriate measures, such as corticosteroid administration. Prior to initiation of \nENHERTU therapy, a chest CT scan should be perf ormed and medical history taken to confirm the absence \nof any comorbidity or history of ILD with the patient and carefully consider the eligibility of the patient for \nENHERTU therapy.  \n \nThe efficacy and safety of ENHERTU as a neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy for the treatment of HR positive, \nHER2 low or HER2 ultralow unresectable or recurrent breast cancer has not been established. ENHERTU \nshould be administered only to patients who have been confirmed to have low  or ultralow  HER2 expression \nbased on approved in vitro diagnostics or medical devices performed at testing facilities or by pathologists \nwith sufficient experience.  \n \nAbout DESTINY -Breast06  \nDESTINY -Breast06  is a g lobal, ra ndomized, open -label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) versus investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, paclitaxel or nab \npaclitaxel) in patients with HR positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 u ltralow (defined as \nIHC 0 with membrane staining) advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients in the trial had no prior \nchemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease and received at least two lines of prior endocrine therapy in \nthe metastatic setting.  Patients also were eligible if they had received one prior line of endocrine therapy\n3 \n combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the metastatic setting and experienced disease progression within six \nmonths of starting first -line treatment or received endocrine th erapy as an adjuvant treatment and \nexperienced disease recurrence within 24 months.  \n  \nHER2 IHC status was confirmed by a central laboratory and determined based on the most recent evaluable \nmetastatic  sample prior to randomization. In tumor samples from pa tients screened for trial eligibility, nearly \ntwo-thirds of tumors previously assessed as IHC 0 at a local laboratory were re -classified as HER2 low or \nHER2 ultralow upon central analysis of the archival tumor sample. It was also observed that approximatel y \n85% to 90% of patients with HR positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer may have actionable \nlevels of HER2 expression.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY -Breast06 is PFS in the HR positive, HER2 low patient population as \nmeasured by BICR. Key secon dary endpoints include PFS by BICR in the overall trial population (HER2 \nlow and HER2 ultralow), overall survival ( OS) in patients in the HER2 low patient population and OS in the \noverall trial population. Other secondary endpoints include objective respon se rate , duration of response , \ntime to first subsequent treatment or death, time to second subsequent treatment or death and safety. Analysis \nof the HER2 ultralow subgroup was not powered to demonstrate statistical significance.  \n  \nDESTINY -Breast06 enrolled  866 patients (n=713 for HER2 low and n=152 for HER2 ultralow) in Asia, \nEurope, North America, Oceania and South America. For more information about the trial, visit \nClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout  Breast Cancer and HER2 Expression  \nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.4 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022, with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally.4 In Japan, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women .1 Approximately 92,000 cases \nof breast cancer were diagnosed  in Japan in 2022, with approximately 17,600 deaths.1 While survival rates \nare high for those diagnosed with early breast cancer, only a bout 30% of patients diagnosed with or who \nprogress to metastatic disease are expected to live five years following diagnosis.2 \n \nHR positive, HER2 negative is the most common breast cancer subtype, accounting for approximately 70% \nof all breast cancers.2 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface \nof many types of tumors, including breast cancer.5 Patients with high levels of HER2 expression (IHC 3+ or \nIHC 2+/ISH+) are classified as HER2 positive and trea ted with HER2 targeted therapies, representing \napproximately 15% to 20% of all breast cancers.6 Historically, tumors that were not classified as HER2 \npositive were classified as HER2 negative, despite the fact that many of these tumors still have some level of \nHER2 expression.3\n4 \n  \nEndocrine therapy is widely given consecutively in the early lines of treatment for HR positive metastatic \nbreast cancer. However, after initial therapy, further efficacy with additional endocrine treatment is often \nlimited.7 Prior to the approval of ENHERTU in HER2 low and HER2 ultralow metastatic breast cancer based \non the DESTINY -Breast04  and DESTINY -Breast06  trials, there were no HER2 targeted therapies approved \nspecifically for these patient populations.8,9  \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU c onsists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 8 5 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or in -situ hybridization \n(ISH)+) breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or \nin the neoadjuvant or adjuv ant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial. \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in m ore than 8 5 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior \nsystemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during o r within six months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial. \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 40 countries for the treatment of ad ult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 \nultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by a locally or regionally approved \ntest, that has progressed on one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Breast06  trial. \n  \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 60 countries worldwide for the treatm ent of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Lung02  and/or DESTINY -Lung05  trials.  Continued approval in China and the U.S. for \nthis indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\n5 \n ENH ERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 70 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) gastric or gastroesophageal \njunction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a pri or trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric02  and/or DESTINY -Gastric06  trials. Continued approval \nin China for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a \nconfirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than  10 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic \ntreatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options based on efficacy results from  the \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 , DESTINY -Lung01  and DESTINY -CRC02  trials. Continued approval for this \nindication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU as a monotherapy or in combination or sequentially with other cancer medicines across multiple \nHER2 targetable cancers.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo  and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019  and DAT ROWAY® in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of  \nENHERTU and DATROWAY.  \n \nAbout the ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two distinct \nADC technology platforms discovered in -house by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC Technology where each \nADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an \nexatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.

    "content": "1 \n \n \nPress Release  \n \nDATROWAY® Approved in China for Patients with Previously \nTreated Metastatic  HR Positive, HER2 Negative Breast Cancer  \n \n• First approval in China for Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s DATROWAY based on TROPION -\nBreast01 results showing 37% reduction in risk of disease progression or death versus chemotherapy  \n• Second DXd  antibody drug conjugate approved in China based on Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd technology   \n \nTokyo – (August  25, 2025)  – DATROWAY® (datopotamab deruxtecan) has been approved in China for \nthe treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2  \nnegative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received prior endocrine therapy an d at \nleast one line of chemotherapy in the advanced setting.   \n \nDATROWAY is a specifically engineered TROP2 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) \ndiscovered by Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568)  and being jointly developed and commercialized by Daiichi \nSankyo and AstraZeneca  (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN ).  \n \nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer in women  in China .1 Approximately 357,000 cases of \nbreast cancer were diagnosed in China in 2022, with nearly 75,000 deaths.1 It is estimated that 70% of \ndiagno sed cases are considered what has been historically called HR positive, HER2 negative breast \ncancer (measured as HER2 score of IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -).2  \n \nThe approval of DATROWAY by China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) is based \non results from the TROPION -Breast01  phase 3 trial. In the trial , DATROWAY significantly reduced th e \nrisk of disease progression or death by 37% compared to investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (hazard \nratio [HR]=0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52 -0.76; p<0.0001) in patients with HR positive, HER2 \nnegative metastatic breast cancer as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Median \nprogression free survival (PFS) was 6.9 months in patients treated with DATROWAY versus 4.9 months \nwith chemotherapy. A confirmed objective response rate (ORR) of 36% was observed in the \nDATROWAY arm compar ed to an ORR of 23% observed in the chemotherapy arm.  There were two \n(0.5%) complete responses (CRs) and 131 partial responses (PRs) (36%) seen in the DATROWAY arm \ncompared to zero (0%) CRs and 84 (23%) PRs in the chemotherapy arm. The median duration of \nresponse (DoR) was 6.7 months (95% CI: 5.6 -9.8) in the DATROWAY arm compared to 5.7 months \n(95% CI: 4.9 -6.8) in the chemotherapy arm. The final overall survival (OS) results of the trial did not \nachieve statistical significance  (HR 1.01; 95% CI: 0.83 -1.22). In an exploratory  sensitivity analysis , OS\n2 \n adjusted for subsequent ADC treatment was 19.1 months in the DATROWAY arm versus 17.5 months in \nthe chemotherapy arm  (HR 0.86; 95% CI: 0.70 -1.06) .3  \n \nIn an exploratory analysis of  the 83 patients  enrolled in TROPION -Breast01 in China , median PFS was \n8.1 months in patients treated with DATROWAY versus 4.2 months with chemotherapy  (HR 0.54 ; 95% \nCI: 0.30 -0.96) and a  confirmed ORR of 38.6% was observed in the DATROWAY arm compared to an \nORR of 17.9% in the chemotherapy arm.4  \n \n“Despite the progress we have made in managing HR positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer, \nmany patients still face limited options once their disease progresses after endocrine therapy and \nchemotherapy,” said Professor Binghe Xu, Director of Clinical Trial Center (GCP) of National Cancer \nCenter, Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, and China leading PI of TROPION -\nBreast01. “The approval of datopotamab deruxtecan, a novel TROP2 directed antibody drug conju gate, \nrepresents a meaningful step forward in expanding therapeutic choices for patients with breast cancer. ” \n \n“The approval of DATROWAY provides  a new treatment op tion for patients with metastatic HR positive, \nHER2 negative breast cancer, enabling timely access to an innovative TROP2  targeted antibody drug \nconjugate  in China,” said Michio  Hayashi, China President, Daiichi Sankyo. “DATROWAY is now the \nsecond DXd antibody  drug conjugate approved in China following ENHERTU and  expands our portfolio \nto meet the evolving treatment needs of patients with a range of breast cancer subtypes. ”  \n \n“Despite considerable advancements in the treatment of HR positive breast cancer , new medicines  are \nstill needed to tackle the frequent and complex challenge of disease progression following initial \ntherapies,” said Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Hematology Business Unit, \nAstraZeneca. “We are proud to bring DATRO WAY to patients in China  for the first time , offering those \nwith metastatic HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer  a new and needed option.”  \n \nIn TROPION -Breast01, t he most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities \nwere stomatit is, nausea, fatigue, decreased leukocytes, decreased calcium, alopecia, decreased \nlymphocytes, decreased hemoglobin, constipation, decreased neutrophils, dry eye, vomiting, increased \nALT, keratitis, increased AST and increased alkaline phosphatase.  Grade 3  or higher adverse reactions in \npatients  (>0.5%)  receiving  DATROWAY were urinary tract infection (1.9%), COVID -19 infection \n(1.7%), interstitial lung disease ( ILD)/pneumonitis (1.1%), acute kidney injury  (0.6%) , pulmonary\n3 \n embolism  (0.6%) , vomiting  (0.6%) , diarrhea  (0.6%) , hemiparesis  (0.6%)  and anemia (0.6%). A grade 5 \nadverse reaction occurred in one patient (0.3%) and was attributed to ILD/pneumonitis . \n \nAbout  TROPION -Breast01   \nTROPION -Breast01  is a global, randomized, multicenter, open -label phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy \nand safety of intravenous DATROWAY (6 mg/kg) once per 21 -day cycle versus investigator’s choice of \nsingle -agent chemotherapy (eribulin, capecitabine, vinorelbine or gemcitabine) in adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HR positive, HER2 negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer \nwho have progressed on and are not suitable for endocrine therapy per investigator assessmen t and have \nreceived at least one prior line of chemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease.  \n \nFollowing disease progression or discontinuation of DATROWAY or chemotherapy, patients had the \noption to receive a subsequent treatment at the discretion o f their physician. Crossover between trial arms \nwas not permitted.  \n \nThe dual primary endpoints of TROPION -Breast01 are PFS as assessed by BICR and OS. Key secondary \nendpoints include ORR, DoR, investigator -assessed PFS, disease control rate, time to first subsequent \ntherapy and safety. The PFS data and additional results for key secondary endpoints of TROPION -\nBreast01 were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology  and OS results were  prese nted at a Virtual \nPlenary session hosted by the European Society for Medical Oncology in February 2025 . \n \nTROPION -Breast01 enrolled 732 patients in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. \nFor more information visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Hormone Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.5 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022 with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally.5 While survival rates are high for those diagnosed with early breast cancer, only about \n30% of patients diagnosed with or progress to metastatic disea se are expected to live five years following \ndiagnosis.2 Approximately 357,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually  in China, representing \nthe most cases diagnosed anywhere in the world , and of these about  20% are diagnosed in the advanced \nor meta static setting.1,6\n4 \n Approximately 70% of diagnosed cases are considered what has been historically called HR positive, \nHER2 negative breast cancer (measured as HER2 score of IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -).2 Endocrine \ntherapy is widely given consecutively i n the early lines of treatment for metastatic HR positive breast \ncancer.7 However, after initial treatment, further efficacy from endocrine therapy is often limited.7 \n \nAbout DATROWAY  \nDATROWAY (datopotamab deruxtecan; datopotamab deruxtecan -dlnk in the U.S. only) is a TROP2 \ndirected ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, DATROWAY is \none of six DXd ADCs in the oncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanced \nprograms in AstraZeneca’s AD C scientific platform. DATROWAY is comprised of a humanized anti -\nTROP2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, developed in collaboration with Sapporo Medical University, \nattached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via \ntetrap eptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n \nDATROWAY (6 mg/kg) is approved in more than 3 5 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HR positive, HER2 negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) \nbreast cancer who have receiv ed prior endocrine -based therapy and chemotherapy for unresectable or \nmetastatic disease based on the results from the TROPION -Breast01  trial.  \n \nDATROWAY (6 mg/kg) is approved in Russia an d the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic EGFR -mutated non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC ) who have received \nprior EGFR -directed therapy and platinum -based chemotherapy based on the results from the TROPION -\nLung05  and TROPION -Lung01  trials. Continued approval for this indication in the U.S. may be \ncontingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trial.  \n \nAbout the DATROWAY Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway with more than 20 trials evaluating \nthe efficacy and safety of DATROWAY across multiple cancers, including  NSCLC, triple negative breast \ncancer and HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. The program includes eight  phase 3 trials in lung \ncancer and five phase 3 trials in breast cancer evaluating DATROWAY as a monotherapy and in \ncombination with other cancer medicines  in various settings.\n5 \n About the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU® in March 2019  and DATROWAY in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for  each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply \nof ENHERTU and DATROWAY.   \n \nAbout the ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two \ndistinct ADC t echnology platforms discovered in -house by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC Technology where \neach ADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payload s \n(an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.

The medicine needs to ha ve shown encouraging preliminary clinical results \nthat demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint over available medicines.  \n \nThe FDA granted this BTD based on data from the DESTINY -Breast09  phase 3 trial  presented  during  a \nspecial late -breaking oral session at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (#ASCO25) Annual \nMeeting.  \n \n“This Breakthrough Therapy Designation provides further recognition of the potential benefit of ENHERTU \nin combination with pertuzumab in the first -line setting of HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer ,” said Ken \nTakeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “ If approved, ENHERTU will continue to redefine the \ntreatment of metastatic breast cancer a s these latest results from DESTINY -Breast09 demonstrate  a median \nprogression -free survival of more than three years when using ENHERTU  plus pertuzumab  in thi s disease\n2 \n setting, which is an improvement over the current standard of care  that has been in place for more than a \ndecade .” \n \nENHERTU has received nine BTDs, including five BTDs for metastatic breast cancer. In addition to the new \nBTD, the four previous BTDs for breast cancer were for second -line HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, \nlater-line HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, later-line HER 2 low metastatic breast cancer  and HER2 \nlow or HER2 ultralow metastatic breast cancer. ENHERTU also received four additional BTDs  for HER2 \npositive (IHC 3+) metastatic solid tumors, HER2 positive metastatic colorectal cancer, HER2 (ERBB2 ) \nmutant metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer.  \n \nThe latest  BTD for ENHERTU represents the thirteenth  BTD across the oncology p ortfolio  of Daiichi \nSankyo . \n \nAbout  DESTINY -Breast09   \nDESTINY -Breast09  is a global, multicenter, randomized, open -label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy \nand safety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) either alone or in combination with pertuzumab versus standard of care \nTHP (a taxane [docetaxel or paclitaxel], trastuzumab and pertuzumab) as a first -line treatment in patients \nwith HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer .  \n \nPatients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either ENHERTU monotherapy with a pertuzumab matching \nplacebo; ENHERTU in combination with pertuzumab; or THP.  Randomization was stratified by prior \ntreatment ( de novo  metastatic disease versus progression from early -stage disease), hormone receptor (HR) \nstatus and PIK3CA  mutation status.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY -Breast09 is progression -free survival (PFS)  as assessed by blinded \nindependent central review in both the ENHERTU monotherapy and ENHERTU combination arms. \nSecondary endpoints include investigator -assessed PFS, overall survival , objective response rate, duration of \nresponse, pharmacokinetics and safety. The investigational arm assessing ENHERTU  monotherapy versus \nTHP remains blinded to patients and investigators and will continue to the final PFS analysis.  \n \nDESTINY -Breast09 enrolled  1,157 patients across  multiple  sites in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and \nSouth America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov .  \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.1 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022, with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally.1 While survival rates are high for those diagnosed with early breast cancer, only about 30%\n3 \n of patients diagnosed with or progress to metastatic disease are expected to live five years following \ndiagnosis.2 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast cancer.3 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a result of HER2  gene \namplification.4 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.5  \n \nHER2 positive metastatic breast cancer is an aggressive disease driven by overexpression or amplification of \nHER2 that affects 15% to 20% of patients with metastatic breast cancer.6 While HER2 targeted therapies \nhave improved outcomes, prognosis remains poor with most patients experiencing disease progression within \ntwo years of first -line treatment with THP, which has been the standard of care for more than a decade.4,7,8,9 \nFurther, approximately one in three patients do not receive  any treatment following first -line therapy due to \ndisease progression or death.10,11  \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan ; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 m onoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 8 5 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or in -situ hybridization \n(ISH)+) breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic  setting or \nin the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 8 5 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior \nsystemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within si x months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 40 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 \nultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by a locally or regionally approved \ntest, that have progressed on one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Breast06  trial.\n4 \n  \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 60 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Lung02  and/or DESTINY -Lung05  trials.  Continued approval in China and the U.S. for \nthis indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 70 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) gastric or gastroesophageal \njunction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric02  and/or DESTINY -Gastric06  trials. Continued approval \nin China for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a \nconfirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 10 countries  worldwide  for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic \ntreatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options based on efficacy results from the \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 , DESTINY -Lung01  and DESTINY -CRC02  trials. Continued approval for this \nindication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU as a monotherapy or in combination or sequentially with other anti -cancer therapies across \nmultiple HER2 targetable cancers.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU  in March 2019  and DATROWAY® in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of \nENHERTU  and DATROWAY.  \n \nAbout  the ADC  Portfolio  of Daiichi  Sankyo   \nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two distinct \nADC technology platforms discovered in -house by Daiichi Sankyo.\n5 \n The ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC Technology where each \nADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an \nexatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleava ble linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently \nconsists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and DATROWAY, a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being \njointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a \nHER3 directed ADC , ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd), a B7 -H3 directed ADC, and raludotatug deruxtecan \n(R-DXd), a CDH6 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with Merck & \nCo., Inc, Rahway, NJ, USA. DS -3939, a TA -MUC1 directed ADC, is being develo ped by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe second Daiichi Sankyo ADC platform consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a modified \npyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) payload. DS -9606, a CLDN6 directed PBD ADC, is the first of several \nplanned ADCs in clinical development utilizing this platform.  \n  \nIfinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan , raludotatug deruxtecan , DS-3939 and DS -9606 are \ninvestigational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy \nhave not been established.  \n \nENHERTU U.S. Important Safety Information  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC 3+ or ISH positive) breast cancer who have received \na prior anti -HER2 -based regimen either:  \n– In the metastatic setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six  \nmonths of completing therapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic:  \n– Hormone receptor (HR) -positive, HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 -ultralow (IHC 0 \nwith membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -approved test, that has progressed \non one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting  \n– HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -approved test, who \nhave received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during \nor within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 \n(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA -approved test, and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration \nof response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and \ndescription of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH positive) gastric or \ngastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based \nregimen\n6 \n  \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic \ntreatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration \nof response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and \ndescription of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, \ndyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue \nENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk \nand to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of \nthese risks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life -threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Cons ider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose 1 level . Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (range: \n0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonit is occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with \nENHERTU.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: \n1.2 to 21).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Co unt [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt\n7 \n ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 \nx 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Nineteen percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time t o first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 \ndays (range: 2 to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.2% of patients.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty -one percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Media n time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 \ndays (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is 20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. \nIf LVEF of 20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \npatients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHER TU has not been studied in \npatients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 4.6% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3 or 4.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until  \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \n \nAdverse Reactions\n8 \n HER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer , HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \n2233 patients in Study DS8201 -A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast02, \nDESTINYBreast03, DESTINY -Breast04, DESTINY -Breast06, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY -Lung02, \nDESTINY -CRC02, and DESTINY -PanTumor02.

Advise patients \nof the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant \nwomen, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions \nin a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during tre atment with ENHERTU and for 7 months \nafter the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing : Verify pregnancy status of females \nof reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : ENHERTU can \ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to \nuse effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 1741 patients with HER2 -positive, HER2 -low, or HER2 -ultralow breast cancer \ntreated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 24% were ≥65 years and 4.9% were ≥75 years. No overall \ndifferences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 year s of age compared \nto younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients \naged ≥65 years (61%) as compared to younger patients (52%). Of the 101 patients with HER2 -mutant \nunresectable or metastat ic NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% \nwere ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of \nage compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with HER2 -positive locally adv anced or \nmetastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, \n56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed \nbetween patients ≥65 years of age compared to young er patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2 -positive \n(IHC 3+) unresectable or metastatic solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -\nPanTumor02, DESTINY -Lung01, or DESTINY -CRC02, 39% were ≥65 years and 9% were ≥75 years. \nNo overall differences in  efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared \nto younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min) . \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic\n12 \n impairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA -1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the \nworld.

DESTINY -\nEndometrial01  will be conducted in collaboration with The GOG Foundation, Inc.  (GOG -F) and the \nEuropean Network of Gynecological  Oncological Trial  (ENGOT) .  \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 direct ed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by \nDaiichi Sankyo  (TSE: 4568) and being jointly developed and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo and \nAstraZeneca  (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN).  \n \nEndometrial cancer  that is recurrent or  diagnosed in advanced stages has a median overall survival of up to \n30 months .1 While there have been recent treatment advances, there is still a need to further improve \noutcomes for patients. HER2 expression (IHC 3+/2+) is associated with aggressive disease and is present in \n18% to 56% of endometrial cancer s.2,3,4,5,6 There currently are no HER2 directed medicines approved in the \nfirst-line endometrial cancer  setting.   \n \n“Following the positive results in the endometrial cancer cohort of DESTINY -PanTumor02, which \ncontributed  to a tumor agnostic approval for previously treated patients with HER2 positive metastatic \ntumors in several regions, we are initiating this first phase 3 trial of ENHERTU in the first-line setting of \nadvanced endometrial cancer ,” said Mark Rutstein, MD, Head , Therapeutic Area Oncology Development, \nDaiichi Sankyo . “The D ESTINY -Endometrial01 trial will help us better understand the role of ENHERTU in \ncombination with immunotherapy as a potential treatment strategy to help improve outcomes compared to \nthe current standard of care in this specific gynecological cancer settin g.”\n2 \n About  DESTINY -Endometrial01  \nDESTINY -Endometrial01  is a global,  multicenter,  randomized, open -label  phase  3 trial evaluating  the \nefficacy  and safety  of ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg)  in combination  with rilvegostomig  or pembrolizumab  versus  \nplatinum -based  chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) in combination  with pembrolizumab  as a first -line \ntherapy  in patients with HER2  expressing (IHC 3+/2+),  pMMR , primary advanced (stage III/IV) or first \nrecurrent endometrial cancer  of any histologic subtype except sarcoma . Patients  will be randomized  in a \n1:1:1  ratio to receive either ENHERTU in combination with rilvegostomig , ENHERTU in combination with \npembroliz umab  or platinum -based chemotherapy in combination with pembrolizumab .  \n \nThe primary  endpoint  is progression -free survival  (PFS)  as assessed  by blinded  independent  central  review  \n(BICR) . The key secondary endpoint is overall survival . Additional secondary endpoints include PFS as \nassessed  by investigator,  objective  response  rate, duration  of response  and safety.  \n \nDESTINY -Endometrial01  will enroll  approximately  600 patients  across  multiple  sites in Asia, Europe , North \nAmerica , Oceania and South America . For more  information  about  the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nRilvegostomig is AstraZeneca’s PD -1/TIGIT bispecific antibody. The TI GIT component of rilvegostomig is \nderived from the clinical -stage anti -TIGIT antibody, COM902, developed by Compugen Ltd. \n(Nasdaq/TASE: CGEN).  Pemb rolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) is Merck’s  (known as MSD outside of the US and \nCanada ) anti -PD-1 therapy.   \n \nAbout Endometrial Cancer  \nEndometrial cancer is the second most common gynecologic cancer and the sixth most common cancer  \namong women worldwide .7 Approximately 420,000  endometrial cancer  cases were diagnosed in 2022, with \nmore than 97,000 deaths globally.8 Incidence and mortality rates of endometrial cancer are expected to \nincrease by approximately 61% and 87% respectively by 2050 .9 Patients with advanced or recurrent \nendometrial cancer have a poor prognosis,  with a median overall survival of up to  30 month s.1  \n \nEndometrial cancer comprises several  molecular subtypes.10 Approximately  20% to 30% of all endometrial \ncancers exhibit high microsatellite instability ( MSI) due to a defective mismatch repair system and are \nclassified as MSI -high or MMR deficient  (dMMR ).10 The remaining 70% to 80%  of cases are considered \nmismatch repair proficient (pMMR) tumors.10 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors.11 HER2 expression  (IHC 3+/  2+) is present in 18% to 56% of endometrial cancers an d is associated \nwith markers of aggressive disease.2,3,4,5,6 HER2 expression is observed almost exclusively in pMMR \ntumors .2\n3 \n Standard of care  first-line treatment of advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer has long included  \ncarboplatin plus paclitaxel.12 The treatment paradigm has recently evolved to incorporate an immune \ncheckpoint inhibitor with carboplatin and paclitaxel , particularly for patients with dMMR  endometrial \ncancer; however, the benefit of this treatment regimen  in pMMR endometrial cancer is less \npronounced.13,14,15,16 There currently are no HER2  directed medicines approved in the first -line endometrial \ncancer setting.  \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU c onsists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n  \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 80 countries worldwide for the treatmen t of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or in -situ hybridization \n(ISH)+) breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or \nin the neoadjuvant or adj uvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n  \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 80 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior \nsystemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n  \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of ad ult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 \nultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by a locally or regionally approved \ntest, that has progressed on one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Breast06  trial. \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 60 countries worldwide for the treatme nt of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Lung02  and/or DESTINY -Lung05  trials. Continued approval in China and the U.S. for \nthis indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\n4 \n ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 70 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) gastric or gastroesophageal \njunction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric02  and/or DESTINY -Gastric06  trials. Continued approval \nin China for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a \nconfirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Brazil, Israel,  Russia , Saudi Arabia,  Switzerland, Taiwan, U.K.  and \nthe U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid \ntumors who have received prior systemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options \nbased on efficacy results from the DESTINY -PanTumor02 , DESTINY -Lung01  and DESTINY -CRC02  \ntrials. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical \nbenefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nAbout  the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU as a monotherapy or in combination or sequentially with other anti -cancer therapies across \nmultiple HER2  targetable cancers.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU  in March 2019  and DATROWAY® in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is respon sible for the manufacturing and supply of \nENHERTU  and DATROWAY.  \n  \nAbout the ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two distinct \nADC technology platforms discovered in -house by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC Techno logy where each \nADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an \nexatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently \nconsists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed AD C, and DATROWAY, a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being \njointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca.

Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, \ndyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue \nENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk \nand to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of \nthese ri sks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life -threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreate d with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patient s for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to  Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose 1 level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equiv alent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at l east 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSC LC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (range: \n0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with \nENHERTU.  \n \nHER 2-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: \n1.2 to 21).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor  \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil C ount [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 \nx 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, a nd \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Nineteen percent had\n7 \n Grade 3  or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 \ndays (range: 2 to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.2% of patients.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn pati ents with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients.

Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunctio n. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. \nIf LVEF o f 20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \npatients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in \npatients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other sol id tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 4.6% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3 or 4.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positiv e gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause f etal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effecti ve contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHE RTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer , HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \n2233 patients in Study DS8201 -A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast02,  \nDESTINYBreast03, DESTINY -Breast04, DESTINY -Breast06, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY -Lung02, \nDESTINY -CRC02, and DESTINY -PanTumor02.

Advise \npatients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in \npregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse \nreactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and \nfor 7 months after the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing : Verify pregnancy status of \nfemales of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 \nmonths after the last dose. Males : Advise male patients with fema le partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the \nlast dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of EN HERTU have not been established in pediatric \npatients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 1741 patients with HER2 -positive, HER2 -low, or HER2 -ultralow breast \ncancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 24% were ≥65 years and 4.9% were ≥75 years. No \noverall differences in ef ficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years of \nage compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions \nobserved in patients aged ≥65 years (61%) as compared to younger patients (52%). Of the  101 \npatients with HER2 -mutant unresectable or metastatic NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, \n40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were \nobserved between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patie nts. Of the 125 patients with \nHER2 -positive locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were obser ved between patients ≥65 years of age compared \nto younger patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2 -positive (IHC 3+) unresectable or metastatic \nsolid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -PanTumor02, DESTINY -Lung01, or \nDESTINY -CRC02, 39% were ≥65  years and 9% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy \nor safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in \npatients wit h moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more \nfrequently. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with \nsevere renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moder ate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (tot al bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA -1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide .\n12 \n About Daiich i Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the \nworld.

Results will be presented today during  a special  late-breaking oral session  (LBA  #1008 ) at the 2025 \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology ( #ASCO 25) Annual Meeting . \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discov ered by \nDaiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and being jointly developed and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo and \nAstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN).   \n \nIn a pre -specified interim analysis , ENHERTU plus pertuzumab reduced the risk of disease progression or \ndeath by 44% versu s THP  (hazard ratio  [HR] : 0.56; 95% confidence interval [ CI]: 0.44 -0.71; p<0.00001) . \nMedian PFS was 40.7 months (95% CI: 36.5 -NC) with  ENHERTU  plus pertuzumab  compared to 26.9 \nmonths (95% CI: 21.8 -NC) for THP as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR).  The PFS \nbenefit for ENHE RTU plus pertuzumab versus THP was consistent across subgroups, including the \nprespecified stratification factors of de nov o or recurrent disease, hormone receptor ( HR) status and PIK3CA  \nmutation status.  \n \nInvestigator -assessed PFS demonstrated a median PFS of 40.7 months  (95% CI: 36.5 -NC) for ENHERTU \nplus pertuzumab compared to 20.7 months  (95% CI: 17.3 -23.5)  for THP (HR : 0.49; 95% CI 0.39 -0.61; \nnominal p -value <0.00001 ).\n2 \n Confirmed objective response rate (ORR ) with ENHERTU plus pertuzumab was 85.1% (95% CI: 81.2-88.5) \nversus  78.6% (95% CI: 74.1-82.5) with THP.  There were  58 complete responses (CR) and 268 partial \nresponses (PR)  with ENHERTU plus pertuzumab compared to 33 CRs and 271 PRs with  THP. Median \nduration of response (DOR) for ENHERTU plus pertuzumab exceeded three years  (39.2 months ) versus 26.4 \nmonths with THP.  \n \nOverall survival (OS) was not mature at the time of the interim analysis  (16% maturity at data cut -off); \nhowever, interim OS data showed an early trend favoring the ENHERTU plus pertuzumab combination \ncompared to THP (HR : 0.84; 95% CI: 0.59 -1.19). An additional investigational arm of the trial  assessing  \nENHERTU  monotherapy versus THP remains blinded to patients and investigators and will continue to the \nfinal PFS analysis.  \n \n\"Patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer often experience disease progression  around two years \nafter initiating standard of care first -line treatment ,” said Sara Tolaney, MD, MPH, Chief of the Division of \nBreast Oncology, Dana -Farber Cancer Institute and Principal Investigator in the DESTINY -Breast09 trial.  \n\"With a median progression -free survival of more than three years, the DESTINY -Breast09 results  show  \ntrastuzumab deruxtecan  combined with pertuzumab has the potential to become a new first -line standard of \ncare for these patients .\"  \n \nThe safety profile of ENHERTU plus pertuzumab in DESTINY -Breast09 was consistent with the known \nprofiles of each individual therapy  with no new safety concerns identified.  Grade 3 or higher  treatment \nrelated adverse events  (TEAEs ) occurred in 54.9% of patients in the ENHER TU plus pertuzumab arm  and \n52.4% of patients  in the THP arm . The most common grade 3 or higher TEAEs  occurring in 5% or more of \npatients treated with ENH ERTU plus pertuzumab were  neutropenia (23.9%), hypokalemia (10.2%), anemia \n(8.4%), fatigue (7.9%),  diarrhea (6.8%) , thrombocytopenia (6.3%) and nausea (5 .0%). Interstitial lung \ndisease (ILD) or pneumonitis  events  occurred in 12.1% of patients treated with ENHERTU  plus pertuzumab  \nas determined by an independent adjudication committee.  The majority of ILD or pneumonitis events were \nlow grade (grade 1 [n= 17; 4.5%] or grade 2 [n= 27; 7.1%]). There were  two grade 5 ILD events  (0.5%)  in the \nENHERTU plus pertuzumab arm . \n \n“ENHERTU continues to transform the treatment of metastatic breast cancer with the first new data in more \nthan a decade to demonstrate improved outcomes  for a broad population of patients with HER2 positive \ndisease compared to THP in the first -line setting ,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi \nSankyo.  “DESTINY -Breast09 shows that initiating treatment with ENHERTU in combination with \npertuzumab at the time of metastatic diagnosis can delay disease progression .”\n3 \n “Bringing ENHERTU earlier in the  treatment of HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer may represent an \nimportant advance ment  for patients. The DESTINY -Breast09 trial showed the combination of ENHERTU \nand pertuzumab in the first -line setting substantially increased the amount of  time before a patient ’s cancer \nprogressed compared to standard of care and nearly doubled the number of patients showing  no signs of \ndisease  on imaging ,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology \nHematology R&D, AstraZeneca. “Establishing a strong therapeutic response as soon as metastatic disease is \ndiagnosed is critical  given that about  one in three patients do not  receive further treatment after  progressing  \nin the first -line setting .” \n \nPatients in t he DESTINY -Breast09 trial received  no prior chemotherapy or HER2 directed therapy  in the \nmetastatic setting . Approximately half  (52.2%) of the patients  in the ENHERTU plus pertuzumab arm had de \nnovo  disease , meaning the breast cancer was first diagnosed  in the metastatic setting . Median duration of \nfollow -up was  nearly 2.5 years  (29.2 months ). As of the data cut-off of February 26, 2025 , 302 (39.6%) \npatients remain ed on treatment, with 174  (45.8 %) patients receiving ENHERTU plus pertuzumab  and 128 \n(33.4 %) patients receiving THP.  \n \nSummary of DESTINY -Breast09  ENHERT U Plus Pertuzumab Arm  Results  \nEfficacy  Measure   ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg)  + \npertuzumab   \n(n=383) THP    \n(n=387)  \nMedian PFS  by BICRi, (months) \n(95% CI)  40.7 months (36.5 -NC) 26.9 months (21.8 -NC) \nHR = 0.56  (0.44 -0.71); p<0.00001  \n24-month PFS ratei, (%) (95% CI)   70.1% (64.8 -74.8)  52.1% (46.4 -57.5)  \nMedian PFS  by investigatorii, \n(months) (95% CI)  40.7 months (36.5 -NC) 20.7 months (17.3 -23.5)  \nHR = 0.49 (0.39 -0.61); p<0.00001  \nMedian PFS2ii, (months) (95% CI)  \n NC 36.5 months (36. 1-NC) \nHR = 0.60 (0.45 -0.79); p=0.00038iv \nConfirmed ORRi,iii (%) (95% CI)  85.1% (81.2 -88.5)  78.6% (74.1 -82.5)  \nCR, % (n)  15.1% (58)  8.5% (33)  \nPR, % (n) 70.0% (268)  70.0% (271)  \nSD, % (n)  9.9% (38)  14.5% (56)  \nMedian DORi, (months) (95% CI)  39.2 months (35.1 -NC) 26.4 months (22.3 -NC) \nRemaining in response at 24 \nmonths  (%) 73.3%  54.9%  \nCI, confidence  interval;  CR, complete  response;  DOR, duration  of response ; NC, not calculable;  ORR,  objective  response  rate; PFS,  \nprogression -free survival ; PR, partial  response;  SD, stable  disease;  THP,  taxane,  trastuzumab  and pertuzumab  \ni Assessed by BI CR  \nii Assessed by investigator  \niii ORR is (CR + PR)  \niv Stratified log -rank test \n \nAbout  DESTINY -Breast09   \nDESTINY -Breast09  is a global, multicenter, randomized, open -label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy \nand safety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) either alone or in combination with pertuzumab versus standard of care\n4 \n THP (a taxane [docetaxel or paclitaxel], trastuzumab and pertuzumab) as a fi rst-line treatment in patients \nwith HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer .  \n \nPatients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either ENHERTU monotherapy with a pertuzumab matching \nplacebo; ENHERTU in combination with pertuzumab; or THP. Randomization was stratif ied by prior \ntreatment ( de novo  metastatic disease versus progression from early -stage disease), hormone receptor (HR) \nstatus and PIK3CA  mutation status.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY -Breast09 is PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review in \nboth the ENHERTU monotherapy and ENHERTU combination arms. Secondary endpoints include \ninvestigator -assessed PFS, OS, objective response rate, duration of response, pharmacokinetics and safety.  \n \nDESTINY -Breast09 enrolled  1,157 patients across  multiple  sites in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and \nSouth America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov .  \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.1 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022, with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally.1 While survival rates are high for those diagnosed with early breast cancer, only about 30% \nof patients diagnosed with or progress to metastatic dise ase are expected to live five years following \ndiagnosis.2 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast cancer.3 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a result of HER2  gene \namplification.4 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.5  \n \nHER2 positive metastatic breast cancer is an aggressive disease driven by overexpression or amplification of \nHER2 that affects 15% to 20% of patients with metastatic breast cancer.6 While HER2 targeted therapies \nhave improved outcomes, prognosis remains poor with most patients experiencing disease progression within \ntwo years of first -line treat ment with THP, which has been the standard of care for more than a decade.4,7,8,9 \nFurther, approximately one in three patients do not  go on to receive  treatment following first -line therapy due \nto disease progression or death.10,11  \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd AD C Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific\n5 \n platform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor paylo ads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 80 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or in -situ hybridization \n(ISH)+) breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or \nin the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 80 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior \nsystemic therapy in the metastatic setting o r developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more t han 30 countries  for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 \nultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by a locally or regionally ap proved \ntest, that have progressed on one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Breast06  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more t han 60 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Lung02  and/or DESTINY -Lung05  trials.  Continued approval in China and the U.S. for \nthis indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 70 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) gastric or gastroesophageal \njunction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric02  and/or DESTINY -Gastric06  trials. Continued approval \nin China for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a \nconfirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Brazil , Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, U.K. and the U.S. for \nthe treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who \nhave received prior systemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment opti ons based on \nefficacy results from the DESTINY -PanTumor02 , DESTINY -Lung01  and DESTINY -CRC02  trials.\n6 \n Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit \nin a confirmatory trial.  \n \nAbout th e ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU as a monotherapy or in combination or sequentially with other anti -cancer therapies across \nmultiple HER2 ta rgetable cancers.    \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019  and DATROWAY® in July 2020 , except  in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of \nENHERTU and DATROWAY . \n \nAbout  the ADC  Portfolio  of Daiichi  Sankyo   \nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven A DCs in clinical development crafted from two distinct \nADC technology platforms discovered in -house by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n  \nThe ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC Technology where each \nADC consists of a monoclonal antibod y attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an \nexatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently \nconsists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and DATROWAY, a TROP2 directed ADC, which are bei ng \njointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a \nHER3 directed ADC, ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd), a B7 -H3 directed ADC, and raludotatug deruxtecan \n(R-DXd), a CDH6 directed ADC, are being jointly develo ped and commercialized globally with Merck & \nCo., Inc, Rahway, NJ, USA. DS -3939, a TA -MUC1 directed ADC, is being developed by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe second Daiichi Sankyo ADC platform consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a modified \npyrrolobenzodiaz epine (PBD) payload. DS -9606, a CLDN6 directed PBD ADC, is the first of several \nplanned ADCs in clinical development utilizing this platform.  \n  \nIfinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan , raludotatug deruxtecan , DS-3939 and DS -9606 are \ninvestigational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy \nhave not been established.\n7 \n ENHERTU U.S. Important Safety Information  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC 3+ or ISH positive) breast cancer who have received \na prior anti -HER2 -based regimen  either:  \n– In the metastatic setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six  \nmonths of completing therapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic:  \n– Hormone receptor (HR) -positive, HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/IS H-) or HER2 -ultralow (IHC 0 \nwith membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -approved test, that has progressed \non one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting  \n– HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -approved test, who \nhave received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during \nor within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors ha ve activating HER2 \n(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA -approved test, and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration \nof response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and \ndescription of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH positive) gastric or \ngastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who  have received a prior trastuzumab -based \nregimen  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic \ntreatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerate d approval based on objective response rate and duration \nof response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and \ndescription of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, \ndyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue \nENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk \nand to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of \nthese risks and the need for ef fective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindications  \nNone.\n8 \n Warnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life -threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A hi gher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symp toms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if re solved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose 1 level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptoma tic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followe d by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (range: \n0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with \nENHERTU.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally A dvanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: \n1.2 to 21).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropeni a (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 \nx 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Brea st Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patient s. Nineteen percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 \ndays (range: 2 to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.2% of patients.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gas tric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty -one percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 \ndays (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk o f developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and\n9 \n absolute decrease from baseline is 20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat L VEF assessment within 3 weeks. \nIf LVEF of 20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \npatients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in \npatients with a history of cl inically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 4.6% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3 or 4.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with loc ally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (p latelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until  \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer , HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \n2233 patients in Study DS8201 -A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast02,  \nDESTINYBreast03, DESTINY -Breast04, DESTINY -Breast06, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY -Lung02, \nDESTINY -CRC02, and DESTINY -PanTumor02.

Advise patients \nof the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant \nwomen, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions\n13 \n in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months \nafter the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing : Verify pregnancy status of females \nof reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : ENHERTU can \ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to \nuse effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with fema le partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of EN HERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 1741 patients with HER2 -positive, HER2 -low, or HER2 -ultralow breast cancer \ntreated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 24% were ≥65 years and 4.9% were ≥75 years. No overall \ndifferences in ef ficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared \nto younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients \naged ≥65 years (61%) as compared to younger patients (52%). Of the  101 patients with HER2 -mutant \nunresectable or metastatic NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% \nwere ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of \nage compared to younger patie nts. Of the 125 patients with HER2 -positive locally advanced or \nmetastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, \n56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were obser ved \nbetween patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2 -positive \n(IHC 3+) unresectable or metastatic solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -\nPanTumor02, DESTINY -Lung01, or DESTINY -CRC02, 39% were ≥65  years and 9% were ≥75 years. \nNo overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared \nto younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moder ate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (tot al bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA -1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi  Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the \nworld.

Results  will be presented  today  as a late-breaking  oral \npresentation  (LBA  #4002 ) at the 2025  American  Society  of Clinical  Oncology  (#ASCO25 ) Annual Meeting  \nand simultaneously  published  in The New England  Journal  of Medicine .  \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by \nDaiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and being jointly developed and commercialized by Daiichi  Sankyo and \nAstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN).    \n \nIn the primary endpoint analysis of OS, ENHERTU reduced the risk of death by 30% versus ramucirumab \nplus paclitaxel (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70; confidence interval [CI]: 0.55-0.90; p=0.0044). M edian OS was 14.7 \nmonths with ENHERTU  (n=24 6) versus 11. 4 months with ramucirumab plus paclitaxel  (n=2 48). \n \nIn the secondary endpoint  analysis  of progression -free survival  (PFS) , ENHERTU demonstrated a 26% \nreduction in the risk of disease progression or death  versus ramucirumab plus paclitaxel (HR : 0.74; 95% CI: \n0.59-0.92; p=0.0074)  as assessed by investigator . Median PFS was 6.7 months with ENHERTU versus 5.6 \nmonths with ramucirumab plus paclitaxel . A confirmed objective response rate ( ORR ) of 44.3% (95% CI: \n37.8-50.9) was seen in patients treated with ENHERTU with seven  complete responses (CR) and 97 partial \nresponses (PR) versus an ORR of 29.1% (9 5% CI: 23.4 -35.3) with three  CRs and 66 PRs in the ramucirumab \nplus paclitaxel  arm (p=0.00 06). Median  duration of response (D OR) was 7.4 months  (95% CI: 5.7 -10.1) in \nthe ENHERTU arm and 5.3 months (95% CI: 4 .1-5.7) in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm. Disease\n2 \n control rate ( DCR ) was 91.9% (95% CI:  87.7-95.1) with ENHERTU versus 75.9% (95% CI: 70.0 -81.2) with \nramucirumab plus paclitaxel.  Improvements in OS  and PFS with ENHERTU were consistent across  \nsubgroups.  \n \n“Gastric cancer is particularly challenging to treat , especially  in the advanced stages where  the five-year \nsurvival rate remains  low,” said Kohei Shitara, MD, Chief, Department of Gastrointestinal Oncology, \nNational Cancer Center Hospital East, Chiba, Japan  and lead investigator in the DESTINY -Gastric04 trial . \n“The superior overall survival demonstrated  in DESTINY -Gastric04 confirms that ENHERTU  could become  \nthe global standard of care in the second -line metastatic setting  of HER2 positive gastric cancer  or \ngastroesophageal junction cancer .”  \n \nThe safety profile of ENHERTU in DESTINY -Gastric04 was consistent with previous gastric cancer clinical \ntrials  with no new safety concerns identified. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment related adverse \nevents occurring in patients treated with ENH ERTU were neutropenia ( 28.7%), anemia (13.9%), \nthrombocytopenia (8.6%), leukopenia (7.4%) and fatigue (7.0%) . Interstitial lung disease (ILD) or \npneumonitis occurred in 13.9% of patients treated with ENH ERTU  and 1.3% treated in the ramucirumab \nplus paclitaxel arm . In the ENHERTU arm, t he majority of ILD or pneumonitis events were low grade (grade \n1 [n= 7; 2.9%] or grade 2 [n= 26; 10.7%]) except for one  grade 3 ILD event ( 0.4%) as determined by an \nindependent adjudication committee.  In the ramucirumab pl us paclitaxel arm, there were two grade 3 (0.9%) \nand one grade 5 (0.4%) ILD event s. \n \n“ENHERTU continues to deliver impressive results  with these new data from DESTINY -Gastric04 , which \nrepresent the first time  a HER2 directed medicine has demonstrated a survival benefit in a randomized phase \n3 trial  in the second -line HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer setting,”  said Ken T akeshita,  MD, G lobal \nHead, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo . “Similar to our strategy  in other tumor types , we continue  to pursue the \ndevelopment of ENHERTU in earlier stages of gastric cancer  and have recently initiated phase 3 trial s \nevaluating ENHERTU as part of a combination regimen  as a first -line treatment in patients HER2 p ositive \nmetastatic disease.”   \n \n“Patients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer who experience  progression after first-line treatment \nhave historically faced poor outcomes ,” said Cristian Massacesi, MD, Chief Medical Officer and Oncology \nChief Development Officer, AstraZeneca . “These results showed that ENHERTU reduced the risk of death \nby nearly one -third in patients with previously treated HER2 positive  metastatic gastric cancer, reinforcing \nthe benefit of ENHERTU in this setting .”\n3 \n ENHERTU  is currently approved in more than 70 countries  in the second -line or third -line metastatic setting \nof HER2 positive gastric cancer based  on DESTINY -Gastric01 , a randomized phase 2 trial, and DESTINY -\nGastric02  and DESTINY -Gastric06 , two single -arm phase 2 trials.  \n \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca are currently evaluating ENHERTU in the first -line metastatic setting \nthrough the DESTINY -Gastric05  and ARETEMIDE -Gastric01  phase 3 trials.  \n \nThe m ajority of p atients in the DESTINY -Gastric04 trial had received no prior treatment with an immune \ncheckpoint inhibitor ( 84.1% in the ENHERTU arm  and 84.7% in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm)  and \nhad two or more metastatic sites (70.3% in the ENHERTU arm and 69.8% in the ramucirumab plus \npaclitaxel arm). Median duration of follow -up was 16.8 months  in the ENHERTU arm and 14.4 months  in \nthe ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm. Median treatment duration was 5.4 months ( range: 0.7-30.3) with \nENHERTU and 4.6 months ( range: 0.9-34.9) with ramucirumab  plus paclitaxel.  Of the patients that \ndiscontinued treatment from the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm, 52 (21.0%) proceeded to receiv e \nENHERTU and 12 (4.8%)  disitamab  vedotin post-trial. As of the data cut -off of October 24, 2024 , 18.9% of \npatients  receiving ENHERTU and 18.5% receiving ramucirumab plus paclitaxel  remained on study \ntreatment .  \n \nSummary of DESTINY -Gastric04 Primary Analysis Results  \nEfficacy Measure  ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg ) \nn = 246 Ramucirumab plus Paclitaxeli  \nn = 248  \nMedian OS, months  \n(95% CI)  14.7 months  11.4 months  \nHR = 0.70 (0.55 -0.90) p = 0.0044  \nMedian PFS , months   \n(95% CI)  6.7 months  5.6 months  \nHR = 0.74 (0.59 -0.92) p = 0.0074  \nConfirmed ORRi,ii, %  \n(95% CI)   44.3% (37.8 -50.9)  29.1% (23.4 -35.3)  \np = 0.0006  \nCR, % (n) 3.0% (7)  1.3% (3)  \nPR, % (n) 41.3% (97)  27.8% (66)  \nSD, % (n) 47.7% (112)  46.8% (111)  \nPD, % (n)  5.5% (13)  9.3% (22)  \nNE, % (n)  2.6% (6)  14.8% (35)  \nDORiii, iv, months  (95% \nCI) 7.4 months  (5.7-10.1)  5.3 months  (4.1-5.7) \nDCRv, % (95% CI)  91.9 (87.7 -95.1)  75.9 (70.0 -81.2)  \nCI, confidence interval;  DCR, disease control rate;  NE, not evaluable; ORR, objective response rate; OS, overall survival; PD, \nprogressive disease; PFS, progression -free survival ; SD, stable disease   \ni ORR is CR + PR \nii Confirmed ORR represents responses confirmed by a follow -up scan ≥four weeks after initial CR/PR  \niii Based on investigator assessment  \niv Based on ORR eligible patients ; ORR eligible patients are those who were randomly assigned at least 77 days (i .e., 2 × 6 weeks  - 1 \nweek) before DCO date of interim analyses  \nv DCR is CR + PR + SD\n4 \n  \nAbout  DESTINY -Gastric04  \nDESTINY -Gastric04  is a global,  randomized,  open -label,  phase  3 trial evaluating  the efficacy  and safety  of \nENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg)  versus  ramucirumab  and paclitaxel  in patients  with HER2  positive  (IHC  3+ or IHC \n2+/ISH+)  unresectable  and/or  metastatic  gastric  or GEJ adenocarcinoma  with disease  progression  on or after \na trastuzumab -containing  regimen.  \n \nThe primary  endpoint  is OS.

For more  information  about  \nthe trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Gastric Cancer  \nGastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the fifth leading cause of cancer -\nrelated death.1 Approximately one million cases of gastric cancer  were diagnosed in 2022.1 Gastric cancer is \nassociated with a poor prognosis, particularly in advanced stages of the disease  where the five-year survival \nrate is 5% to 10 %.2 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors, including gastric cancer.3 Approximately one in five gastric cancers are  considered HER2 positive.3,4 \n \nPrior to the results of the DESTINY -Gastric04 trial of ENHERTU, no other HER2 directed medicine has \ndemonstrated a survival benefit in the second -line metastatic setting in a randomized clinical trial.5 \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo an d the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 80 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or in -situ hybridization\n5 \n (ISH)+) breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or \nin the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial. \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 80 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior \nsystemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial. \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 \nultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) breast cancer, as d etermined by a locally or regionally approved \ntest, that has progressed on one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Breast06  trial. \n  \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 60 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who  have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Lung02  and/or DESTI NY-Lung05  trials.  Continued approval in China and the U.S. for \nthis indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n  \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 70 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) gastric or gastroesophageal \njunction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the res ults \nfrom the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric02  and/or DESTIN Y-Gastric06  trials. Continued approval \nin China for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a \nconfirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Brazil, Israel, Russia , Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, U.K. and the U.S. for \nthe treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who \nhave received prior systemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options based on \nefficacy results from the DESTINY -PanTumor02 , DESTINY -Lung01  and DEST INY-CRC02  trials.  \nContinued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit \nin a confirmatory trial.\n6 \n About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU as a monotherapy or in combination or sequentially with other anti -cancer therapies across \nmultiple HER2 targetable cancers.  \n  \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019  and DATROWAY® in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of \nENHERTU and DATROWAY . \n \nAbout the ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of  seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two distinct \nADC technology platforms discovered in -house by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC Technology where each \nADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an \nexatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleava ble linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently \nconsists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and DATROWAY, a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being \njointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a \nHER3 directed ADC , ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd), a B7 -H3 directed ADC, and raludotatug deruxtecan \n(R-DXd), a CDH6 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with Merck & \nCo., Inc, Rahway, NJ, USA. DS -3939, a TA -MUC1 directed ADC, is being develo ped by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe second Daiichi Sankyo ADC platform consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a modified \npyrrolobenzodiazepine  (PBD ) payload. DS -9606, a CLDN6 directed PBD ADC, is the first of several \nplanned ADCs in clinical development ut ilizing this platform.  \n \nIfinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan, raludotatug deruxtecan, DS -3939 and DS -9606 are \ninvestigational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy \nhave not been established.\n7 \n ENHERTU U.S. Important Safety Information  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC 3+ or ISH positive) b reast cancer who have received \na prior anti -HER2 -based regimen either:  \n– In the metastatic setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six  \nmonths of completing therapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic:  \n– Hormone receptor (HR) -positive, HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 -ultralow (IHC 0 \nwith membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -approved test, that has progressed \non one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic sett ing  \n– HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -approved test, who \nhave received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during \nor within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy  \n \n• Unre sectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 \n(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA -approved test, and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based  on objective response rate and duration \nof response.

Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and \ndescription of clinical benefit in  a confirmatory trial.  \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, \ndyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue \nENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk \nand to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of \nthese risks and the need for ef fective contraception.  \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life -threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients\n8 \n with moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Cons ider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose 1 level . Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (ra nge: \n0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with \nENHERTU.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastri c or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: \n1.2 to 21).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERT U. Monitor  \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then m aintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 \nx 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more tha n 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Nineteen percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutroph il count was 22 \ndays (range: 2 to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.2% of patients.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcino ma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty -one percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 \ndays (range: 4 to 187). Febril e neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 1 0-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. \nIf LVEF of 20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHER TU in \npatients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in \npatients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.\n9 \n  \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 4.6% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3 or 4.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adve rse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potentia l \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERT U. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopeni a (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until  \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \nAdverse Reactio ns \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer , HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \n2233 patients in Study DS8201 -A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast02, \nDESTINYBreast03, DESTINY -Breast04, DESTINY -Breast06, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY -Lung02, \nDESTINY -CRC02, and DESTINY -PanTumor02.

Advise patients \nof the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant \nwomen, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions \nin a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months \nafter the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing : Verify pregnancy status of females \nof reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : ENHERTU can \ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to \nuse effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with fema le partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during\n13 \n treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of EN HERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 1741 patients with HER2 -positive, HER2 -low, or HER2 -ultralow breast cancer \ntreated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 24% were ≥65 years and 4.9% were ≥75 years. No overall \ndifferences in ef ficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared \nto younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients \naged ≥65 years (61%) as compared to younger patients (52%). Of the  101 patients with HER2 -mutant \nunresectable or metastatic NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% \nwere ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of \nage compared to younger patie nts. Of the 125 patients with HER2 -positive locally advanced or \nmetastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, \n56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were obser ved \nbetween patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2 -positive \n(IHC 3+) unresectable or metastatic solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -\nPanTumor02, DESTINY -Lung01, or DESTINY -CRC02, 39% were ≥65  years and 9% were ≥75 years. \nNo overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared \nto younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moder ate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (tot al bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA -1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the \nworld.

Pathologic complete \nresponse is defined as  no evidence of invasive cancer cells in the removed breast tissue and lymph nodes \nfollowing  treatment.   \n \nThe secondary endpoint of event -free survival (EFS) was not mature at the time of this analysis; however, \nEFS data showed an early  positive  trend favoring ENHERTU followed by  THP compared to standard of \ncare. The trial will continue to follow EFS.  \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 directed  DXd  antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by \nDaiichi Sankyo  (TSE: 4568)  and being jointly developed and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo and \nAstraZeneca  (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) .  \n \nApproximately o ne in three  patients with early -stage breast cancer  are considered high -risk, as they are more \nlikely to experience disease recurrence  and have a poor prognosis .1,2 Achieving pCR in early -stage HER2  \npositive breast cancer is associated with improved long-term outcomes .3,4 The c urrent  standard of care in \nmany regions of the world  in this neoadjuvant setting consists of combination chemotherapy  regimen s. These \nregimens often includ e anthracyclines, which can be challenging for patients to tolerate  and may result in \nlong-term cardiovascular side effects . Further, nearly  half of  patients who receive neoadjuvant treatment do \nnot achieve  pCR, reinforcing the need for new treatment options .2,5\n2 \n  \n“There are still  many patients with early -stage breast cancer  who do not achieve a pathologic complete \nresponse  with treatment  in the neoadjuvant setting , increasing the risk of disease recurrence ,” said Ken \nTakeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “The se topline  results from DESTINY -Breast11 \ndemonstrate  that ENHERTU  followed by THP could offer  patients with HER2 positive breast cancer  a \npromising new treatment approach  prior to surgery , setting more patients on a path towards a potential cure .”  \n \n“The clinically meaningful improvement in pathologic complete response and  the safety  data seen in \nDESTINY -Breast11 highlight the potential of ENHERTU  to challenge the current standard of care  in early -\nstage HER2  positive breast cancer ,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, \nOncology Hematology R&D, AstraZeneca.  “ENHERTU is already an important treatment option in the \nmetastatic setting, and these data have the potential to  allow this medicine  to move into early stages of \ndisease  where c ure is possible .”   \n \nENHERTU followed by THP showed an improved safety profile compared to ddAC -THP . The safety \nprofile s of ENHERTU and THP  were consistent with the known profile s of each individual medicine  with no \nnew safety concerns  identified. Rates of interstitial lung disease were similar across the ENHERTU followed \nby THP and the ddAC -THP arms  as determined by an independent adjudication committee . \n \nFollowing a recommendation by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, patient enrollment in a third \narm of the study evaluating ENHERTU alone  was closed based on a previous interim efficacy assessment of \nthe study arms . \n \nData from DESTINY -Breast11 will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and shared with regulatory \nauthoritie s. \n \nENHERTU  has demonstrated improved outcomes in six phase 3  breast cancer trials across different subtypes \nand stages of disease, including the recently announced DESTINY -Breast09  trial in the  first-line HER2  \npositive metastatic setting. ENHERTU  is also being studied in several ongoing breast cancer trials, including \nthe DESTINY -Breast05  phase 3  trial, which is evaluating ENHERTU  in the high-risk adjuvant  early HER2  \npositive setting.  \n \nAbout  DESTINY -Breast11  \nDESTINY -Breast11  is a global,  multicenter,  randomized,  open -label,  phase  3 trial evaluating  the efficacy  \nand safety  of neoadjuvant  ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg)  monotherapy  or ENHERTU  followed  by THP (paclitaxel,  \ntrastuzumab  and pertuzumab)  versus  the standard  of care regimen  in patients  with high-risk (lymph  node\n3 \n positive  [N1-3] or primary  tumor  stage  T3-4), locally  advanced  or inflammatory  HER2  positive  early -stage  \nbreast  cancer.   \n \nPatien ts were  randomized  1:1:1  to receive  either  eight  cycles  of ENHERTU  monotherapy;  four cycles  of \nENHERTU  followed  by four cycles  of THP;  or four cycles  of ddAC  (dose -dense  doxorubicin  and \ncyclophosphamide)  followed  by four cycles  of THP.   \n \nThe primary  endpoint  of DESTINY -Breast11  is rate of pCR (absence  of invasive  disease  in the breast  and \nlymph  nodes ). Secondary  endpoints  include  EFS, invasive  disease -free survival , overall  survival  and safety . \n \nDESTINY -Breast1 1 enroll ed 927 patients  across  multiple  sites in Asia,  Europe,  North  America  and South  \nAmerica.  For more  information  about  the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Early Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.6 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022, with more than 66 5,000 \ndeaths globally.6  \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers.7 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a \nresult of  HER2 gene amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in \nbreast cancer.8 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.9  \n \nApproximately one in three  patients with early -stage breast c ancer  are considered high -risk, as they are more \nlikely to experience disease recurrence  and have a poor prognosis .1,2 Achieving pCR in early -stage HER2  \npositive breast cancer is associated with improved long -term outcomes .3,4 The c urrent standard of care in \nmany regions of the world  in this neoadjuvant setting consists of combination chemotherapy  regimen s. These \nregimens often include  anthracyclines, which can be challenging for patients to tolerate  and may result in \nlong-term cardiovascul ar side effects . Further, nearly half of patients who receive neoadjuvant treatment do \nnot achieve pCR, reinforcing the need for new treatment options .2,5 \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU c onsists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.\n4 \n  \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 75 countries worldwide for the treatment  of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or in -situ hybridization \n(ISH)+) breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or \nin the neoadjuvant or adju vant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in mo re than 75 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior \nsystemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or  within six months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries  for the treatment of adult  patients with \nunresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 \nultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by a locally or regionally approved \ntest, that has progressed on one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Breast06  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 50 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who  have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Lung02  and/or DESTINY -Lung05 trials. Continued approval in China and the U.S. for \nthis indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 65 countries worldwide for the treatmen t of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) gastric or gastroesophageal \njunction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric02  and/or DESTINY -Gastric06  trials. Continued approval \nin Chi na for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a \nconfirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Brazil, Israel, Russia , Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, U .K. and the U.S. for \nthe treatment of adult patients  with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who \nhave received prior systemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options based on \nefficacy results from the  DESTINY -PanTumor02 , DESTINY -Lung01  and DESTINY -CRC02  trials. \nContinued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit \nin a confirmatory trial.\n5 \n  \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU as a monotherapy or in combination or sequentially with other anti -cancer therapies across \nmultiple  HER2 targetable cancers.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU  in March 2019  and DATROWAY® in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmain tains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of \nENHERTU  and DATROWAY.  \n \nAbout the ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted  from two distinct \nADC technology platforms discovered in -house by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC Technology where each \nADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisome rase I inhibitor payloads (an \nexatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently \nconsists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and DATROWAY, a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being \njointly developed and commercial ized globally with AstraZeneca. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a \nHER3 directed ADC, ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd), a B7 -H3 directed ADC, and raludotatug deruxtecan \n(R-DXd), a CDH6 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally wit h Merck & \nCo., Inc, Rahway, NJ, USA . DS-3939, a TA -MUC1 directed ADC, is being developed by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe second Daiichi Sankyo ADC platform consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a modified \npyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) payload. DS -9606, a CLD N6 directed PBD ADC, is the first of several \nplanned ADCs in clinical development utilizing this platform.  \n \nIfinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan, raludotatug deruxtecan, DS -3939 and DS -9606 are \ninvestigational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country.

Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, \ndyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue \nENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk \nand to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can  cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of \nthese risks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life -threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Cons ider\n7 \n consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose 1 level . Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (ra nge: \n0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with \nENHERTU.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastri c or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: \n1.2 to 21).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor  \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil C ount [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 \nx 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, a nd \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Nineteen percent had \nGrade 3  or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 \ndays (range: 2 to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.2% of patients.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn pati ents with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg,  a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty -one percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 \ndays (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunctio n. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. \nIf LVEF o f 20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \npatients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in \npatients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.\n8 \n HER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 4.6% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3 or 4.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER 2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU ca n cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to us e effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dos e \nof ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until  \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer , HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \n2233 patients in Study DS8201 -A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast02, \nDESTINYBreast03, DESTINY -Breast04, DESTINY -Breast06, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY -Lung02, \nDESTINY -CRC02, and DESTINY -PanTumor02.

Advise \npatients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in \npregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regardi ng the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse \nreactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and \nfor 7 months after the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing : Verify pregnancy status of \nfemales of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administ ered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 \nmonths after the last dose. Males : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive\n12 \n potential to use effectiv e contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the \nlast dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric \npatients . \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 1741 patients with HER2 -positive, HER2 -low, or HER2 -ultralow breast \ncancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 24% were ≥65 years and 4.9% were ≥75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years of \nage compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions \nobserved in patients aged ≥65 years (61%) as compared to younger patients (52%). Of the 101 \npatients with HER2 -mutant unresectable or metast atic NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, \n40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were \nobserved between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with \nHER2 -positive locally a dvanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared \nto you nger patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2 -positive (IHC 3+) unresectable or metastatic \nsolid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -PanTumor02, DESTINY -Lung01, or \nDESTINY -CRC02, 39% were ≥65 years and 9% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy \nor safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in \npatients with moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with mo derate renal impairment more \nfrequently. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with \nsevere renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SU SPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA -1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the \nworld.

However, there are no HER2 directed therapies approved for other cancers that are HER2 \noverexpressed (IHC 3+)  or amplified  (ERBB2 ).  \n \nThe sNDA is based on data from  four phase 2 trials including HERALD, an  investigator- initiated trial \nconducted in Japan, DESTINY -PanTumor02, DESTINY -CRC02  and DESTINY -Lung01  where ENHERTU \ndemonstrated clinically meaningful responses across a broad range of tumors.  \n “The clinical benefit seen  across several studies supports the potential of ENHERTU to  treat any type of \nHER2 positive metastatic  solid cancer ,” said Yuki Abe, PhD, Head of R&D Division in Japan and H ead of  \nResearch , Daiichi Sankyo. “ We look forward to working with the Japan health autho rity to bring th e first \nantibody drug conjugate with a tumor agnostic indication to patients .” \n About HERALD HERALD is a multicenter , open- label, single -arm phase  2 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) in  patients wit h unresectable, advanced or rec urrent solid tumors  refractory or \nintolerant to standard treatments  and have HER2  gene amplification in circulating tumor DNA , including \nbiliary tract, cervical, colorectal, endometrial, esophageal, gastric, melanoma, non-small cell lung, ovarian, \npancreatic, prostate, salivary gland, small intestine, urothelial cancer or other tumors.\n2 \n The primary endpoint of HERALD is confirmed objective response rate (ORR)  as assessed by  investigator . \nSecondary endpoints include duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), progression- free \nsurvival (PFS),  time to treatment failure,  overall survival (OS), ORR by independent central review  and \nsafety. Results from HERALD were  published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology . \n \nHERALD enrolled 62 patients at seven  sites in Japan . For more information about the trial, visit Japan’s \nRegistry of Clinical Trials . \n \nAbout DESTINY- PanTumor02  \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 is a global, multicenter, multi -cohort, open- label phase 2 trial evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) for the treatment of previously treated HER2 expressing \ntumors, including biliary tract, bladder, cervical, endometrial, ovarian, pa ncreatic cancer or other tumors.  \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint of DESTINY -PanTumor02 is confirmed ORR as assessed by investigator. \nSecondary endpoints include DOR, DCR, PFS, OS, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics. Results from  \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 were  published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology . \n DESTINY -PanTumor02 enrolled 267 patients, including 75 HER2 positive (IHC 3+) adult patients, at \nmultiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n About DESTINY- Lung01  \nDESTINY -Lung01\n is a global phase 2, open- label, two -cohort trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg and 5.4 mg/kg) in patients with HER2  mutant (cohort 2, n=91) or HER2 \noverexpressing (defined as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+) (cohort 1 and 1a, n=90) unresectable or metastatic NSCLC who had progressed after one or more systemic therapies.  \n The primary endpoint is confirmed ORR by independent central review. Key secondary endpoints include DOR, DCR, PFS, OS and safety. Results  from the HER2 mutant cohort were published in The New England \nJournal of Medicine . Full results from the HER2 overexpressing cohort were published in The Lancet \nOncology . \n \nDESTINY -Lung01 enrolled 181 patients, including 17 HER2 positive (IHC 3+) adult patients, at multiple \nsites, including Asia, Europe and North America. For more information about the trial, visit \nClinicalTrials.gov.\n3 \n About DESTINY- CRC02  \nDESTINY -CRC02  is a global, randomized, two arm, parallel, multicenter phase 2 trial evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of two doses (5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg) of ENHERTU in patients with locally advanced, \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive colorectal cancer of BRAF wild- type, RAS wild -type or RAS \nmutant tumor types previously treated with standard therapy. The trial was conducted in two stages. In the \nfirst stage, patients (n=80) were randomized 1:1 to receive either 5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg of ENHERTU. In \nthe second stage, additional patients (n=42) were enrolled in the 5.4 mg/kg arm.  \n The primary endpoint is confirmed ORR as assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints include DOR, DCR, investigator-assessed confirmed ORR, clinical benefit ratio, PFS, OS and safety. R esults from DESTINY -CRC02  were  published  in The Lancet Oncology .  \n DESTINY -CRC02 enrolled 122 patients, including 64 HER2 positive (IHC 3+) adult patients, at multiple \nsites in Asia, Europe and North America. For more information about the trial, vis it ClinicalTrials.gov . \n About HER2 Expression  and Amplification in Solid Tumors   \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of various tissue cells \nthroughout the body and is involved in normal cell growth.1 In some cancers, the HER2  gene is  amplified or \nthe cells  have activating mutations .2 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a result of HER2  gene \namplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis.3  \n \nHER2 directed therapies have been used to treat breast, colorectal , gastric, lung and  salivary gland cancers. \nAlthough HER2 is expressed or amplified in solid tumor types including  biliary tract, bladder, cervical, \nendometrial, ovarian and pancreatic cancers, testing is not routinely performed in these additional tumor \ntypes and as a result, available literature is limited . 4  \n About ENHERTU  ENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam- trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most adva nced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide- based cleavable linkers. \n \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 75 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or in -situ hybridization \n(ISH)+) breast cancer who have received a prior an ti-HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or\n4 \n in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting therapy based on the results from the DESTINY- Breast03  trial.  \n ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 75 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior \nsystemic therapy in the metastatic setting or d eveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 \nultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) breast cancer, as  determined by a locally or regionally approved \ntest, that have progressed on one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast06  trial.   \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 50 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2)  mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Lung02 and/or DESTINY -Lung05 trials. Continued approval in China and the U.S. for \nthis indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 65 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric02  and/or DESTINY -Gastric06  trials.

The key secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS) was not mature at the time of this \nplanned interim analysis ; however, interim OS data showed an early  trend favoring the ENHERTU \ncombination compared to THP .  \n The second arm assessing ENHERTU  monotherapy versus THP remains blinded to patients and investigators \nand will continue to the final PFS analysis.  HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer is an aggressive disease driven by overexpression or amplification of \nHER2 that affects 15% to 20% of patients with metastatic breast cancer.\n1 While HER2 targeted therapies \nhave improved outcomes, prognosis remains poor with most patients experiencing disease progression within two years of first -line treatment with THP, which has been the standard of care for more than a decade.\n2,3,4,5 \nFurther, approximately one in three patients never go on to receive  treatment following first -line therapy due \nto disease progression or death.6,7\n2 \n  \n“The results of DESTINY -Breast09 reinforce the importance of e ffectively targeting HER2 to achieve \ndurable disease control  early in the treatment of HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer ,” said Ken \nTakeshita, MD, Global Head , R&D , Daiichi Sankyo. “ Building on the positive results seen with ENHERTU \nin the second- line setting, t hese new findings suggest that starting treatment with ENHERTU in  combination \nwith pertuzumab at the time of metastatic diagnosis delay s disease progression, postponing the time until  \nadditional treatment may be needed .”  \n “This is the first trial in more than a decade to demonstrate superior efficacy  across a broad HER2 positive \nmetastatic breast cancer patient population compared to the current first- line standard of care,” said Susan \nGalbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology Hematology R&D, AstraZeneca. “This is a significant milestone for patients and sets the foundation for ENHERTU in combination with pertuzumab as \nan important treatment option in the first- line HER2 positive setting .”  \n \nThe safety profile of ENHERTU in combination with pertuzumab was consistent with the known profiles of \neach individual therapy.   \n Data from the combination arm of DESTINY -Breast09  will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting \nand shared with  regulatory authorities.  \n About  DESTINY- Breast09   \nDESTINY -Breast09  is a global, multicenter, randomized, open- label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy \nand safety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) either alone or in combination with pertuzumab versus standard of care \nTHP (a taxane [docetaxel or paclitaxel], trastuzumab and pertuzumab) as a first -line treatment in patients \nwith HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer .  \n \nPatients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either ENHERTU monotherapy with a pertuzumab matching \nplacebo; ENHERTU in combination with pertuzumab; or THP . Randomization was stratified by prior \ntreatment ( de novo metastatic disease versus progression from early -stage disease), hormone receptor (HR) \nstatus and PIK3CA mutation status.  \n  \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY- Breast09 is PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review  in \nboth the ENHERTU monotherapy and ENHERTU combination arms . Secondary endpoints include \ninvestigator- assessed PFS, OS, objective response rate, duration of response, pharmacokinetics and safety.\n3 \n DESTINY -Breast09 enrolled  1,157 patients across multiple  sites  in Africa, Asia , Europe, North America,  \nand South America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.8 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022, with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally.8 While survival rates are high for those diagnosed with early breast cancer, only about 30% \nof patients diagnosed with or progress to metastatic disease are expected to live five years following \ndiagnosis.9 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including breast cancer.\n10 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a result of HER2 gene \namplification.2 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.11  \n HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer is an aggressive disease driven by overexpression or amplification of \nHER2 that affects 15% to 20% of patients with metastatic breast cancer.\n1 While HER2 targeted therapies \nhave improved outcomes, prognosis remains poor with most patients experiencing disease progression within two years of first -line treatment with THP, which has been the standard of care for more than a decade.\n2,3,4,5 \nFurther, approximately one in three patients never go on to receive  treatment follo wing first -line therapy due \nto disease progression or death.6,7  \n \nAbout ENHERTU  ENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam- trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC.

Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and \ndescription of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY  \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, \ndyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue \nENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of \nthese risks and the need for effective contraception.  \n  \nContraindications  \nNone. \n Warnings and Precautions \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Cons ider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose 1 level . Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks. \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2-Low, and HER2- Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (range:\n7 \n 0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with \nENHERTU.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2 to 21). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 10\n9/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level. For febrile neutropenia ( ANC <1.0 \nx 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by 1 level. \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2-Low, and HER2- Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Nineteen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time t o first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 \ndays (range: 2 to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.2% of patients. \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty- one percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients. \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is 20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. \nIf LVEF of 20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHER TU has not been studied in \npatients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2-Low, and HER2- Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 4.6% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3 or 4.  \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of\n8 \n ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until  \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nHER2 -Positive, HER2-Low, and HER2- Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \n2233 patients in Study DS8201-A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY- Breast01, DESTINY -Breast02, \nDESTINYBreast03, DESTINY- Breast04, DESTINY -Breast06, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY -Lung02, \nDESTINY -CRC02, and DESTINY- PanTumor02.

Advise patients \nof the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during tre atment with ENHERTU and for 7 months \nafter the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females \nof reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can \ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to \nuse effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 1741 patients with HER2-positive, HER2-low, or HER2- ultralow breast cancer \ntreated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 24% were ≥65 years and 4.9% were ≥75 years. No overall \ndifferences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 year s of age compared \nto younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients \naged ≥65 years (61%) as compared to younger patients (52%). Of the 101 patients with HER2- mutant \nunresectable or metastat ic NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% \nwere ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with HER2- positive locally advanced or \nmetastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, \n56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed\n12 \n between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2- positive \n(IHC 3+) unresectable or metastatic solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -\nPanTumor02, DESTINY -Lung01, or DESTINY -CRC02, 39% were ≥65 yea rs and 9% were ≥75 years. \nNo overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared \nto younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of society that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the world.

Median progression free survival ( PFS) was 6.9 months in \npatients treated with DATROWAY  versus 4.9 months with chemotherapy. A confirmed objective response \nrate (ORR) of 36% was observed in  the DATROWAY arm compared to an ORR of 23% observed in the \nchemotherapy arm. The median duration of response (DoR) was 6.7 months (95% CI: 5.6 -9.8) in the \nDATROWAY arm compared to 5.7 months (95% CI: 4.9 -6.8) in the chemotherapy arm. The final overall \nsurvival (OS) results of the trial did not achieve statistical significance (median OS of 18.6 months in the \nDATROWAY arm versus 18.3 months in the chemotherapy arm [HR 1.01; 95% CI : 0.83-1.22]) and may \nhave been affected by subsequent ADC treatment.\n2 “With  the majority of breast cancer cases historically considered HR positive, HER2 negative,  additional \ntreatment options  are needed to improve outcomes for patients  with metastatic  disease that continues to \nprogress  following endocrine -based therapy and initial chemotherapy,” said Barbara Pistilli, MD, Head of \nthe Breast Cancer Unit in the Medical Oncology Department of Gustave Roussy Cancer Center, Villejuif, \nFrance.  “The approval of  DATROWAY in the EU  will provide these patients with a new treatment option \nthat can help slow the progression of this disease.”   \n \n“Treating metastatic HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer presents challenges, particularly treatment \nresistance and disease progression that occur following endocrine -based therapy and initial chemotherapy ,” \nsaid Ken Keller, Global Head of Oncology Business, and President and CEO, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. \n“DATROWAY  represents the second  antibody drug conju gate approved for breast cancer based on Daiichi \nSankyo’s DXd technology and the  third medic ine to be approved  in the EU from our oncology pipeline , \nunderscoring our commitment to creating new medicines for patients with cancer .”  \n \n“Though the HR  positive breast cancer treatment landscape has evolved in the last several years, disease \nprogression on front -line therapies remains a  common  and complex challenge  for patients with metastatic \ndisease ,” said Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Hematology Business Unit, \nAstraZeneca. “ With today’s approval of DATROWAY, patients  in the E U with HR positive, HER2 negative \nbreast cancer  now have a new and needed alternative to conventional chemotherapy .”  \n  \nGrade 3 or higher adverse events from a pooled safety analysis of two clinical studies , including 443 patients \nwho received DATROWAY (6 mg/kg) for a median duration of 6.2 months (range: 0.7 -28.5) , were \nstomatitis (7.9%), fatigue (4.3%), anemia (3.2%), AST increased (2.7%), vomiting (1.6%), ALT increased \n(1.6%), nausea (1.4%), urinary tract infection (1.4%), COVID -19 (1.1%), decreased appetite (1.1%), \nneutropenia (1.1%) and pneumonia (1.1%). Grade 5 adverse events occurred in 0.7% of patients due to \ninterstitial lung disease/pneumonitis, dyspnea  and sepsis.   \n \nAbout TROPION -Breast01  \nTROPION -Breast01  is a global, randomized, multicenter, open -label phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and \nsafety of intravenous DATROWAY  (6 mg/kg) once per 21 -day cycle versus investigator’s choice of single -\nagent chemotherapy (eribulin, capecitabine, vinorelbine or gemcitabine) in adult patients with unresectable \nor metastatic HR positive, HER2 negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breas t cancer who have \nprogressed on and are not suitable for endocrine therapy per investigator assessment and have received at \nleast one prior line of chemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease.\n3 Following disease progression or discontinuation of DATROWAY  or chemotherapy, patients had the option \nto receive a subsequent treatment at the discretion of their physician. Crossover between trial arms was not \npermitted.  \n \nThe dual primary endpoints of TROPION -Breast01 are PFS as assessed by BICR and OS. Key secondary \nendpoints include ORR , DoR , investigator -assessed PFS, disease control rate, time to first subsequent \ntherapy and safety. The PFS data and additional results for key secondary endpoints of TROPION -Breast01 \nwere published in  the Journal of Clinical Oncology  and OS results  were presented  at a Virtual Plenary \nsession hosted by the European Society for Medical Oncology  in February 2025 . \n \nTROPION -Breast01 enrolled 732 patients in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. For \nmore information visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Hormone Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.1 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022 with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally .1 In Europe, approximately 557,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually .2 While \nsurvival rates are high for those diagnosed with early breast cancer, only about 30% of patients diagnosed \nwith or who progress to metastatic disease are expected to live five years following diagnosis.3  \n \nApproximately 70% of diagnosed cases are considered what has been historically called HR positive, HER2 \nnegative breast cancer (measured as HER2 score of IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -).3 Endocrine therap y is \nwidely given consecutively in the early lines of treatment for metastatic HR positive breast cancer.4 \nHowever, after initial treatment , further efficacy from  endocrine t herapy  is often limited .4  \n \nAbout DATROWAY   \nDATROWAY  (datopotamab deruxtecan ) is a TROP2 directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s \nproprietary DXd ADC Technology, DATROWAY  is one of six DXd ADCs in the oncology pipeline of \nDaiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanced programs in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. \nDATROWAY  is comprised of a humanized anti -TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, developed in \ncollaboration with Sapporo Medical University, attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads \n(an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable  linkers.  \n \nDATROWAY is approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer who have received prior endocrine -based therapy and \nchemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease based on the results of the  TROPION -Breast01  trial.\n4  \nAbout the DATROWAY  Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway with more than 20 trials evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of DATROWAY  across multiple cancers, including non -small cell lung cancer, triple \nnegative breast cancer and HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. The program includes eight phase 3 \ntrials in lung cancer and five phase 3 trials in breast cancer evaluating DATROWAY  as a monotherapy and \nin combination with other anticancer treatments in various settings.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU® in March 2019  and DATROWAY in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of \nENHERTU and DATROWAY .   \n \nAbout the ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two distinct \nADC technology platforms discovered in -house by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC Technology where each \nADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an \nexatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleava ble linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently \nconsists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and DATROWAY, a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being \njointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a \nHER3 directed ADC , ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd), a B7 -H3 directed ADC, and raludotatug deruxtecan \n(R-DXd), a CDH6 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with Merck & \nCo., Inc, Rahway, NJ, USA. DS -3939, a TA -MUC1 directed ADC, is being develo ped by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe second Daiichi Sankyo ADC platform consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a modified \npyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) payload. DS -9606, a CLDN6 directed PBD ADC, is the first of several \nplanned ADCs in clinical development utilizing this platform.  \n \nIfinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan, raludotatug deruxtecan, DS -3939 and DS -9606 are \ninvestigational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy \nhave not been established.\n5 About Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the \nworld.

Currently, regardless of HER2 expression, endocrine- based therapies are widely used in \nthe early lines of treatment for HR positive metastatic breast  cancer . Following endocrine -based therapy, \nsome patients discontinue treatment, and others are treated with conventional chemotherapy which is \nassociated with poor response rates and outcomes.2,3,4,5\n2 \n “This approval introduces a new treatment option for HR positive metastatic breast cancer s that express \nHER2 ,” said Giuseppe Curigliano, MD, PhD, Professor of Medical Oncology at the University of Milan and \nthe Head of the Division of Early Drug Development at the European Institute of Oncology, IRCCS, Italy \nand Principal Investigator of DESTINY -Breast06. “In DESTINY -Breast06, ENHERTU out performed \nchemotherapy, providing progression- free survival of more than one year for patients with HR positive, \nHER2 low or HER2 ultralow metastatic breast cancer , demonstrating  the benefit of treating these patients \nwith ENHERTU instead of chemotherapy.”   \n In the DESTINY -Breast06 trial, ENHERTU demonstrated a 38% reduction in the risk of disease progression \nor death versus chemotherapy in patients with chemotherapy- naïve HR positive, HER2 low metastatic breast \ncancer (n=713; hazard ratio [HR] 0.62; 95% confi dence interval [CI]: 0.52- 0.75; p<0.0001) as assessed by \nblinded independent review (BICR). Median progression- free survival (PFS) was 13.2 months (95% CI: \n11.4- 15.2) in the ENHERTU arm compared to 8.1 months (95% CI: 7.0- 9.0) in the chemotherapy arm.  \n  \nThe confirmed objective response rate (ORR) in the HER2 low population was 56.5% (95% CI: 51.2- 61.7) in \nthe ENHERTU arm versus 32.2% (95% CI: 27.4- 37.3)  in the chemotherapy arm. Median duration of \nresponse (DOR) was 14.1 months  (95% CI: 11.8- 15.9)  in the ENHERTU arm  versus 8.6 months  (95% CI: \n6.7-11.3)  in the chemotherapy arm . \n \nIn the overall trial population of patients with chemotherapy- naïve  HR positive, HER2 low or HER2 ultralow \nmetastatic breast cancer (n=866), ENHERTU achieved a similar 36% reduction in the risk of disease \nprogression or death versus chemotherapy (HR 0.64; 95% CI: 0.54- 0.76; p<0.0001). A median PFS of 13.2 \nmonths (95% CI: 12.0- 15.2) was seen in patients treated with ENHERTU compared to 8.1 months (95% CI: \n7.0-9.0) in patients treated with chemotherapy.  \n  \nConfirmed ORR in the overall trial population was 57.3% (95% CI: 52.5- 62.0) in the ENHERTU arm versus \n31.2% (95% CI: 26.8- 35.8) in the chemotherapy arm. Median DOR was 14.3 months (95% CI: 12.5- 15.9) in \nthe ENHERTU arm versus 8.6 months  (95% CI: 6.9- 11.5)  in the chemotherapy arm . \n \nAn exploratory analysis of the HER2 ultralow population (n= 152; HR 0.78; 95% CI: 0.50- 1.21) showed the \nclinically meaningful improvement in PFS was consistent between patients with HER2 low and HER2 \nultralow expression, with 13.2 months (95% CI: 9.8- 17.3) in patients treated with ENHERTU compared to \n8.3 months (95% C I: 5.8- 15.2) in those treated with chemotherapy. Confirmed ORR was 61.8% (95% CI: \n50.0- 72.8) in the ENHERTU arm versus 26.3%  (95% CI: 16.9- 37.7)  in the chemotherapy arm. Median DOR \nwas 14.3 mont hs (95% CI: 9.2- 20.7) in the ENHERTU arm versus 14.1 months (95% CI: 5.9, not estimable)  \nin the chemotherapy arm.\n3 \n “ENHERTU continues to evolve what is possible with breast cancer treatment , becom ing the first HER2 \ndirected medicine approved in the EU for patients with HR positive metastatic breast cancer with HER2 low \nor HER2 ultralow expression following endocrine therapy,” said Ken Keller, Global Head of Oncology \nBusiness, and President and CEO, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. “Today’s approval expands the use of ENHERTU to now include an earlier treatment setting of HER2 low metastatic breast cancer and broadens the patient \npopulation eligible for treatment to those with HER2 ultralow disease. ”  \n \n“ENHERTU continues to open up new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with metastatic \nbreast cancer,” said Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Hematology Business Unit, \nAstraZeneca. “This approval underscores the importance of testing metastatic breast cancer tumors for any IHC staining to identify patients with HR positive, HER2 low or HER2 ultralow disease who may be eligible for ENHERTU once sustained responses are no longer achieved with  endocrine- based  therapy.”  \n In DESTINY -Breast06, the safety profile of ENHERTU was consistent with previous clinical trials with no \nnew safety concerns identified. Grade 3 or grade 4  treatment -related adverse events from a pooled safety \nanalysis of patients treated with ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) across multiple tumor types in clinical studies included neutropenia (18.0%), anemia (10.5%), fatigue (7.8%), leukopenia (6.0%), thrombocytopenia (5.4%), nausea (4.9%), lymphopenia (3.9%), hypokalemia (3.8%), transaminases increased (3.5%), diarrhea (2.5%), vomiting (2.4%), decreased appetite (1.8%), pneumonia (1.3%), and ejection fraction decreased (1.0%). Grade 5 adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% of patients, including interstitial lung disease (1.1%).  ENHERTU is already approved in more than 75 countries, including the EU, for patients with HER2 low metastatic breast cancer who have received a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed \ndisease recurrence during or within six months of  completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n \nFinancial Considerations  \nFollowing this approval in the EU, an amount of $125 million is due from AstraZeneca to Daiichi Sankyo as \na milestone payment for the  HER2 low and HER2 ultralow chemotherapy-naive breast cancer  indication . \nSales of ENHERTU in most EU territories are recognized by Daiichi Sankyo. For further details on the financial arrangements, please consult the collaboration agreement from March 2019. \n \nAbout DESTINY- Breast06  \nDESTINY -Breast06  is a g lobal, randomized, open- label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) versus investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, paclitaxel or nab \npaclitaxel) in patients with HR positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH- ) or HER2 ultralow (defined as \nIHC 0 with membrane staining) advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients in the trial had no prior\n4 \n chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease and received at least two lines of prior endocrine therapy in \nthe metastatic setting. Patients also were eligible if they had received one prior line of endocrine therapy combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the metastatic setting and experienced disease progression within six months of starting first- line treatment or received endocrine therapy as an adjuvant treatment and \nexperienced disease recurrence within 24 months.  \n  HER2 IHC status was confirmed by a central laboratory and determined based on the most recent evaluable HER2 IHC  sample prior to randomization. In tumor samples from patients  screened for trial eligibility , \nnearly two-thirds of tumors previously assessed as IHC 0 at a local laboratory  were re -classified as HER2  \nlow or HER2  ultralow upon central analysis of the archival tumor sample . It was also observed that \napproximately 85% to 90% of patients with HR positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer may have actionable levels of HER2 expression.  \n The primary endpoint of DESTINY-Breast06 is PFS in the HR positive, HER2 low patient population as \nmeasured by BICR. Key secondary endpoints include PFS by BICR in the overall trial population (HER2 \nlow and HER2 ultralow), OS in patients in the HER2 low pa tient population and OS in the overall trial \npopulation. Other secondary endpoints include ORR, DOR, time to first subsequent treatment or death, time to second subsequent treatment or death and safety. Analysis of the HER2 ultralow subgroup was not powere d to demonstrate statistical significance.  \n  DESTINY -Breast06 enrolled 866 patients (n=713 for HER2 low and n=152 for HER2 ultralow) in Asia, \nEurope, North America, Oceania and South America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n About Breast Cancer and HER2 Expression  \nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.\n6 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022 , with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally.6 In Europe, approximately 557,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually.7 While \nsurvival rates are high for those diagnosed with early breast cancer, only about 30% of patients diagnosed with or who progress to metastatic disease are expected to live five years following diagnosis.\n1 \n \nHR positive, HER2 negative is the most common breast cancer subtype, accounting for approximately 70% \nof all breast cancers.1 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface \nof many types of tumors, including breast cancer.8 Patients with high levels of HER2 expression (IHC 3+ or \nIHC 2+/ISH+) are classified as HER2 positive and treated with HER2 targeted therapies, representing \napproximately 15% to 20% of all breast cancers.9 Historically, tumors that were not classified as HER2\n5 \n positive were classified as HER2 negative, despite the fact that many of these tumors still carry some level of \nHER2 expression.10  \n \nEndocrine therapy is widely given consecutively in the early lines of treatment for HR positive metastatic \nbreast cancer. However, after initial therapy, further efficacy with additional endocrine treatment is often \nlimited.2 Prior to the approval of ENHERTU in HER2 low and HER2 ultralow metastatic breast cancer based \non the DESTINY -Breast04  and DESTINY -Breast06  trials, there were no HER2 targeted therapies approved \nspecifically for  these patient  populations .11,12  \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.

Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and \ndescription of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\n6 \n  \n \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue \nENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of \nthese risks and the need for effective contraception.   \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n Warnings and Precautions Interstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life -threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose 1 level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (range: \n0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with \nENHERTU.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: \n1.2 to 21).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor  \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 10\n9/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 \nx 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by 1 level.\n7 \n HER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Nineteen percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time t o first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 \ndays (range: 2 to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.2% of patients.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty -one percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Media n time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 \ndays (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. \nIf LVEF of 20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHER TU has not been studied in \npatients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 4.6% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3 or 4.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and  for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \n2233 patients in Study DS8201-A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY-Breast02, \nDESTINYBreast03, DESTINY-Breast04, DESTINY-Breast06, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY -Lung02, \nDESTINY -CRC02, and DESTINY-PanTumor02.

Advise patients \nof the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant \nwomen, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation: There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months \nafter the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females \nof reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females: ENHERTU can \ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to \nuse effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 1741 patients with HER2 -positive, HER2 -low, or HER2 -ultralow breast cancer \ntreated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 24% were ≥65 years and 4.9% were ≥75 years. No overall \ndifferences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 year s of age compared \nto younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients \naged ≥65 years (61%) as compared to younger patients (52%). Of the 101 patients with HER2 -mutant \nunresectable or metastat ic NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% \nwere ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with HER2-positive locally adv anced or \nmetastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY- Gastric01, \n56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed \nbetween patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2 -positive \n(IHC 3+) unresectable or metastatic solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-\nPanTumor02, DESTINY-Lung01, or DESTINY -CRC02, 39% were ≥65 years and 9% were ≥75 years. \nNo overall differences in  efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared \nto younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment: A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment: In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST). \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA-1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n Please see accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide .\n12 \n  \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the \nworld.

Median progression -free survival (PFS) was 6.9 months in patients \ntreated with DATROWAY compared to 4.9 months in those  treated with chemotherapy.  \n \n“HR positive, HER2 negative unresectable or recurrent  breast cancer has historically been  treated with \nconventional chemotherapy  after progression with hormon e therapy , which is associated with  poor response \nrates  and a low five-year survival rate,” said Kei Kiuchi, Vice President, Oncology Marketing D epartment , \nJapan Business Unit, Daiichi Sankyo.  “Patients now will have access to DATROWAY, the first TROP2 \ndirected medicine  available  in Japan  for this specific type of metastatic breast cancer .”  \n \nIn TROPION -Breast01, adverse reactions occurred in 93.6% (337/360 patients ) of the 360 patients \n(including 31 Japanese patients) in the DATROWAY (6 mg/kg)  arm. The most common adverse reactions \nincluded nausea (51.1%), stomatitis (50.0%), alopecia (36.4% ), fatigue (23.6% ) and dry eye (21.7% ). In \nJapanese patients, interstitial lung disease  (ILD) occurred in 6.5% of patients treated with DATROWAY.\n2 \n  \nDATROWAY  is approved in Japan with a Warning for ILD. As cases of ILD, including fatal cases, have  \noccurred in DATROWA Y-treated patients , DATROWAY  is to be used in close collaboration with a \nrespiratory  disease expert. Patients should be closely observed during therapy by monitoring for early signs \nor symptoms  of ILD (such as dyspnea, cough or fever) and performing periodical  percutaneous oxygen \nsaturation (SpO 2) tests, chest X -ray scans and chest CT scans. If abnormalities are observed, discontinue \nadministration of DATROWAY  and take appropriate measures, such as corticosteroid administration. Prior \nto initiation of  DATROWAY  therapy, a chest CT scan should be performed and medical history taken to \nconfirm the absence  of any comorbidity or history of ILD with the patient and carefully consider the \neligibility of the patient for  DATROWAY  therapy.  \n \nAdditional regulatory submissions for DATROWAY in breast  cancer are under  review in the EU, China  and \nother regions.   \n \nAbout TROPION -Breast 01 \nTROPION -Breast01  is a global, randomized, multicenter, open -label phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and \nsafety of intravenous  DATROWAY  (6 mg/kg) once per 21 -day cycle  versus investigator’s choice of single -\nagent chemotherapy (eribulin, capecitabine, vinorelbine or gemcitabine) in adult patients  with unresectable \nor metastatic HR positive, HER2 negative (IHC 0 , IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who progressed on \nand are not suitable for endocrine therapy per investigator assessment and have received at least one \nadditional systemic therapy for unresectable or metastatic disease.   \n \nFollowing disease progression or discontinuation of DATROWAY  or chemotherapy, patients had the option \nto receive subsequent treatment at the discretion of their physician . Crossover between trial arms was not \npermitted.  \n \nThe dual primary endpoints of TROPION -Breast01 are PFS as assessed by BICR and overall survival  (OS) . \nKey secondary endpoints include overall response rate , duration of response, investigator -assessed PFS, \ndisease control rate, time to first subsequent therapy and safety. The PFS data and additional results for key \nsecondary endpoints of TROPION -Breast01 were published in the  Journal of Clinical Oncology . The OS \ndata were presented  at a Virtual Plenary session hosted by the European Society for Medical Oncology  in \nFebruary 2025.  \n \nTROPION -Breast01 enrolled 7 32 patients in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America.

Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, DATROWAY is one of \nsix DXd ADCs in the oncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanced programs in \nAstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. DATROWAY  is comprised of a humanized anti -TROP2 IgG1 \nmonoclonal antibody, developed in collaboration with Sapporo Medical  University, attached to a number of \ntopoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cl eavable linkers.  \n \nDATROWAY  is approved in Japan and the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer who have received prior endocrine -based therapy and \nchemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease based on the results from the TROPION -Breast01  trial.  \n \nAbout the DATROWAY Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway with more than 20 trials evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of DATROWAY  across multiple cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer , triple \nnegative breast cancer and HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer . The program includes eight  phase 3 \ntrials in lung cancer and five phase 3 trials in breast cancer evaluating DATROWAY as a monotherapy and \nin combination with other anticancer treatments in various settings.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU® in March 2019  and DATROWAY in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo\n4 \n maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. D aiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of \nENHERTU and DATROWAY.   \n \nAbout the ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two distinct \nADC technology platforms discovered in -house by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n  \nThe ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC Technology where each \nADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an \nexatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleava ble linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently \nconsists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and DATROWAY, a TROP2  directed ADC, which are being \njointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca.

DESTINY -\nGastric04 is the first phase 3 trial of ENHERTU in HER2 positive advanced gastric cancer.  \n \n“ENHERTU i s the first HER2  directed medicine to demonstrate a n improvement in overall survival  in a \nrandomized  phase 3 trial in the second- line metastatic setting of  patients with HER2  positive gastric cancer ,\n2 \n reinforcing previous findings seen in our other  earlier phase  gastric cancer trials, ” said Ken Takeshita, MD, \nGlobal Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “ With these DESTINY -Gastric04 results, w e will work with global \nregulatory authorities to seek approval in regions where ENHERTU is not currently indicated as a second-\nline option as well as work to secure full approval in regions where  ENHERTU is  conditional ly approved. ” \n \n“We are committed to advancing the care of patients with metastatic gastric cancer  and continuing to \nunderstand the role of ENHERTU in earlier lines of treatment ,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, \nExecutive Vice President, Oncology Hematology R&D, AstraZeneca . “The results of DESTINY -Gastric04 \nshow that second -line treatment with ENHERTU can extend survival compared with a chemotherapy- based \nregimen  and should be considered for all eligible patients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer .”  \n \nThe safety profile seen in DESTINY -Gastric04  is consistent with the established safety profile  of \nENHERTU.  \n \nData from DESTINY -Gastric04 will be presented at a n upcoming  medical meeting and shared with  global \nregulatory authorities.  \n \nAbout  DESTINY- Gastric04  \nDESTINY -Gastric04  is a global , randomized, open- label,  phase 3 trial  evaluating the efficacy  and safety  of \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg)  versus  ramucirumab  and paclitaxel  in patients  with  HER2  positive  (IHC  3+ or IHC  \n2+/ISH+)  unresecta ble and/or  metastatic  gastric  or GEJ  adenocarcinoma  with  disease progression on or after  \na trastuzumab -containing  regimen.  \n \nThe primary  endpoint  is OS. Secondary  endpoints  include  investigator -assessed  progression- free survival, \nobjective  response rate, duration of  response, disease control  rate and safety .  \n \nDESTINY -Gastric04 enrolled  494 patients  in Asia,  Europe  and South  America.  For more  information  about  \nthe trial, visit  ClinicalTrials.gov.  \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Gastric Cancer  \nGastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the fifth leading cause of cancer -\nrelated death.1,2 Approximately one million cases of gastric cancer  were diagnosed in  2022.2 Gastric cancer is \nassociated with a poor prognosis, particularly in advanced stages of the disease where the five-year survival \nrate is 5% to 10 %.1,2 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors, including gastric cancer .4 Approximately one in five gastric cancers are considered HER2 positive.4,5\n3 \n  \nFollowing disease progression in the first -line metastatic setting of HER2 positive gastric cancer, there \nhistorically have been no HER2 directed medicine s that have demonstrated a survival benefit in the second-\nline metastatic setting  in a randomized clinical trial.3  \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 m onoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 75 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or in -situ hybridization \n(ISH)+) breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or \nin the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting therapy based on the results from the DESTINY- Breast03  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 75 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior \nsystemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S.  for the treatment of adult patients with  unresectable or \nmetastatic  HR positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH- ) or HER2 ultralow (IHC 0 with membrane \nstaining) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA approved test, that have progressed on one or more \nendocrine therapies  in the metastatic setting based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast06  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 50 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2 ( ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Lung02 and/or DESTINY -Lung05 trials.  Continued approval in China and the U.S. for \nthis indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 65 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) gastric or gastroesophageal \njunction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab- based regimen based on the results\n4 \n from the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric02  and/or DESTINY -Gastric06  trials . Continued approval \nin China for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a \nconfirmatory trial.  \n ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Brazil, Israel, Russia and the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options based on efficacy results from the DESTINY -PanTumor02, DESTINY -Lung01 and DESTINY -CRC02  trials. Continued approval for this \nindication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program A comprehensive global clinical  development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  \n About the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019 and DATROWAY\n® in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC.

Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and \ndescription of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\n6 \n  \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY  \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue \nENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of \nthese risks and the need for effective contraception.  \n  \nContraindications  \nNone.  \nWarnings and Precautions \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Cons ider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose 1 level . Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks. \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2-Low, and HER2- Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (range: 0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonit is occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with \nENHERTU.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: \n1.2 to 21).  \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor  \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 10\n9/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), i nterrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \nHER2 -Positive, HER2-Low, and HER2- Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Nineteen percent had\n7 \n Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 \ndays (range: 2 to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.2% of patients. \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty- one percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients. \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is 20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. \nIf LVEF of 20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \npatients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHER TU has not been studied in \npatients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2-Low, and HER2- Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 4.6% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3 or 4. \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive poten tial to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and  for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until  \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nHER2 -Positive, HER2-Low, and HER2- Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \n2233 patients in Study DS8201-A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY- Breast01, DESTINY -Breast02, \nDESTINYBreast03, DESTINY- Breast04, DESTINY -Breast06, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY -Lung02, \nDESTINY -CRC02, and DESTINY- PanTumor02.

Advise \npatients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in \npregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during tre atment with ENHERTU and \nfor 7 months after the last dose. \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of \nfemales of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 \nmonths after the last dose. Males : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the \nlast dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility. \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric \npatients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 1741 patients with HER2-positive, HER2-low, or HER2- ultralow breast \ncancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 24% were ≥65 years and 4.9% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 year s of \nage compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions \nobserved in patients aged ≥65 years (61%) as compared to younger patients (52%). Of the 101 patients with HER2 -mutant unresectable or metastat ic NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, \n40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with \nHER2 -positive locally adv anced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2- positive (IHC 3+) unresectable or metastatic \nsolid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-PanTumor02, DESTINY-Lung01, or \nDESTINY -CRC02, 39% were ≥65 years and 9% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy \nor safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in \npatients with moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with \nsevere renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide .\n12 \n About Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the world.

The recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission, which has \nthe authority to grant marketing authorizations for medicines in the EU.  \n \nIn the DESTINY -Breast06 trial, ENHERTU demonstrated a 38% reduction in the risk of disease progression \nor death versus chemotherapy in patients with chemotherapy -naïve HR positive,  HER2 low metastatic breast \ncancer (n=713; hazard ratio [HR] 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]:  0.52-0.75; p<0.0001)  as assessed by \nblinded independent review (BICR) . Median progression -free survival (PFS) was 13.2 months (95% CI: \n11.4-15.2) in the ENHERTU arm compared to 8.1 months (95% CI: 7.0 -9.0) in the chemotherapy arm.  \n \nConfirmed objective  response rate ( ORR ) in the HER2 low population was 56.5% (95% CI: 51.2 -61.7) in the \nENHERTU arm versus 32.2% in the chemotherapy arm (95% CI: 27.4 -37.3). There were nine complete \nresponses (CRs) and 194 partial responses (PRs) seen in the ENHERTU arm, compared to zero CRs and 114\n2 \n PRs in the chemotherapy arm. Median duration of response ( DOR ) was 14.1 months in the ENHERTU arm \nversus 8.6 months in the chemotherapy arm.  \n \nIn the overall trial population  of patients with  chemotherapy -naïve HR positive, HER2 low or HER2 ultralow \nmetastatic breast cancer  (n=866) , ENHERTU achieved a similar  36% reduction in the risk of disease \nprogression or death versus chemotherapy  (HR 0.6 4; 95% CI: 0.5 4-0.76; p<0. 0001). A median PFS of 13.2 \nmonths  (95% CI: 1 2.0-15.2) was seen in patients treated with  ENHERTU  compared to 8.1 months  (95% CI: \n7.0-9.0) in patients treated with chemotherapy.  \n \nConfirmed  ORR in the overall trial population was 57.3%  (95% CI: 52.5 -62.0) in the ENHERTU arm versus \n31.2%  (95% CI: 26.8 -35.8)  in the chemotherapy arm. There were 13 CRs and 237 PRs seen in the \nENHERTU arm, compared to zero CRs and 134 PRs in the chemotherapy arm. Median DOR was 14.3 \nmonths in the ENHERTU arm versus 8.6 months in the chemotherapy arm.    \n \nAn exploratory analysis of the HER2 ultralow population (n=153 ; HR 0.78; 95% CI: 0.50 -1.21)  showed the \nclinically meaningful improvement in PFS was consistent between patients with HER2 low and HER2 \nultralow expression , with 13.2 months (95% CI: 9.8 -17.3) in patients treated with ENHERTU compared to \n8.3 months (95% CI: 5.8 -15.2) in those treated with chemotherapy. Confirmed ORR was 61.8% (95% CI: \n50.0-72.8) in the ENHERTU ar m versus 26.3% in the chemotherapy arm (95% CI: 16.9 -37.7). There were \nfour CRs and 43 PRs seen in the ENHERTU arm, compared to zero CRs and 20 PRs in the chemotherapy \narm. Median DOR was 14.3  months  in the ENHERTU arm  versus 14.1 months in the chemotherapy arm.   \n \n“ENHERTU is the first HER2 directed treatment and antibody drug conjugate to show a progression free \nsurvival of more than one year in patients  with HER2 low or HER2 ultralow metastatic breast cancer \nfollowing endocrine therapy,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “ The CHMP \nrecommendation is encouraging and supports our goal of further developing and advancing the way breast \ncancer is classified and treated .”  \n \n“Endocrine therapy is typically used in the initial treatment of HR positive metastatic breast cancer but as the \ndisease progresses the benefit of continued endocrine therapy is limited and subsequent standard of care \nchemotherapy is associated with poor outcomes ,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice \nPresident, Oncology  Hematology R&D, AstraZeneca. “ENHERTU  has the potential to be the first HER2  \ndirected treatment for patients in the EU with HR positive, HER2 low or HER2 ultralow metastatic breast \ncancer directly following endocrine therapy, which would mark an important shift in how patients in this \nsetting are treated. ”\n3 \n In DESTINY -Breast06, t he safety profile of ENHERTU was consistent with previous breast cancer clinical \ntrials with no new safety concerns identified. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment related treatment \nemergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring in 5% or more of patient s treated with ENHERTU were \nneutropenia (20.7%), leukopenia (6.9%) and anemia (5.8%). Interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis \noccurred in 11.3% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The majority of ILD or pneumonitis events were lo w \ngrade (grade 1 [n=7; 1.6%] or grade 2 [n=36; 8.3%]). There were three grade 3 ILD events (0.7%), zero \ngrade 4 events and three grade 5 events (0.7%) as determined by an independent adjudication committee.  \n \nENHERTU is already approved in more than 75 countries, including the EU, for patients with HER2  low \nmetastatic breast cancer who have received a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed \ndisease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Breast04  trial. \n \nAbout DESTINY -Breast06  \nDESTINY -Breast06  is a g lobal, randomized, open -label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) versus investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, paclitaxel or nab \npaclitaxel) in patients with HR positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 ultralow (defined as \nIHC 0 with membrane staining ) advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients in the trial had no prior \nchemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease and received at least two lines of prior endocrine therapy in \nthe metastatic setting. Patients also were eligible if they had received  one prior line of endocrine therapy \ncombined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the metastatic setting and experienced disease progression within six \nmonths of starting first -line treatment or  received endocrine therapy as an adjuvant treatment and \nexperienced disease recurrence within 24 months.  \n  \nHER2 IHC status was confirmed by a central laboratory and determined based on the most recent evaluable \nHER2 IHC sample prior to randomization. In tumor samples from patients screened for trial eligibility, \nnearly two -thirds of tumors previously assessed a s IHC 0 at a local laboratory were re -classified as HER2 \nlow or HER2 ultralow upon central analysis of the archival tumor sample. It was also observed that \napproximately 85% to 90% patients with HR positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer may have \nactionable levels of HER2 expression.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY -Breast06 is PFS in the HR positive, HER2 low patient population as \nmeasured by BICR. Key secondary endpoints include PFS by BICR in the overall trial population (HER2 \nlow and HER2 ultralow), OS in patients in the HER2 low pa tient population and OS in the overall trial \npopulation. Other secondary endpoints include ORR , DOR , time to first subsequent treatment or death, time \nto second subsequent treatment or death and safety. Analysis of the HER2 ultralow subgroup was not \npowere d to demonstrate statistical significance.\n4 \n   \nDESTINY -Breast06 enrolled 866 patients (n=713 for HER2 low and n=153 for HER2 ultralow) in Asia, \nEurope, North America, Oceania and South America. For more information about the trial, visit \nClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Breast Cancer and HER2 Expression  \nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.1 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022 with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally.1 In Europe, approximately 557,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually .2 While \nsurvival rates are high for those diagnosed with early breast cancer, only about 30% of patients diagnosed \nwith or who progress to metastatic disease are expected to live five years following diagnosis.3 \n \nHR positive, HER2 negative is the most common breast cancer subtype, accounting for approximately 70% \nof all breast cancers.3 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface \nof many types of tumors, including breast cancer.4 Patients with high levels of HER2 expression (IHC 3+ or \nIHC 2+/ISH+) are classified as HER2 positive and treated with HER2 targeted therapies, representing \napproximately 15 % to 20% of all breast cancers.5 Historically, tumors that were not classified as HER2 \npositive were classified as HER2 negative, despite the fact that many of these tumors still carry some level of \nHER2 expression.6  \n \nEndocrine therap y is widely given consecutively in the early lines of treatment for HR positive metastatic \nbreast cancer. However, after initial therapy, further efficacy with additional endocrine treatment is often \nlimited.7 The current standard of care following endocrine therapy is chemotherapy, which is associated with \npoor response rates and outcomes.7,8,9,10 \n \nPrior to the approval of ENHERTU in HER2 low metastatic breast cancer based on the  DESTINY -Breast04  \ntrial, there were no targeted therapies approved specifically for patients with HER2 low expression.11 There \nare no targeted therapies specifically approved in the EU for patients with HER2 ultralow expression.12 \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 m onoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.\n5 \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 75 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or in -situ hybridization \n(ISH)+) breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or \nin the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 75 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior \nsystemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within si x months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg)  is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients  with unresectable or \nmetastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive , HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 ultralow (IHC 0 \nwith membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -approved test, that have progressed on one \nor more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting based on the results from the  DESTINY -Breast06  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 5 0 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Lung02  and/or DESTINY -Lung05  trials.  Continued approval in China and the U.S. for \nthis indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 65 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) gastric or gastroesophageal \njunction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the re sults \nfrom the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric02  and/or DESTINY -Gastric06  trials. Continued approval \nin China for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a \nconfirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in  Brazil , Israel, Russia  and the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic \ntreatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options based on efficacy results from the \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 , DESTINY -Lung01  and DESTINY -CRC02  trials. Continued approval for this \nindication in the U.S. may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a \nconfirmatory trial.\n6 \n About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers. Trials in combination with other \nanticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are under way.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019  and DATROWAY® in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of \nENHERTU and DATROWAY . \n \nAbout  the ADC  Portfolio  of Daiichi  Sankyo   \nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two distinct \nADC technology platforms discovered in -house by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n  \nThe ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd  ADC Technology where each \nADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an \nexatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently \nconsists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and DATROWAY , a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being \njointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a \nHER3 directed ADC, ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd), a B7 -H3 directed ADC, and raludotatug de ruxtecan \n(R-DXd), a CDH6 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with Merck & \nCo., Inc, Rahway, NJ, USA . DS-3939, a TA -MUC1 directed ADC, is being developed by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe second Daiichi Sankyo ADC platform consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a modified \npyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) payload. DS -9606, a CLDN6 directed PBD ADC, is the first of several \nplanned ADCs in clinical development utilizing this platform.  \n  \nIfinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan , raludotatug deruxtecan, DS -3939 and DS -9606 are \ninvestigational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy \nhave not been established.  \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the \nworld.

    "content": "1     \nPress Release  \n \nDatopotamab Deruxtecan Recommended for Approval in the EU by \nCHMP for Patients with Previously Treated Metastatic HR Positive, \nHER2 Negative Breast Cancer  \n• Recommendation based on TROPION -Breast01 results showing D aiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s \ndatopotamab deruxtecan reduced risk of disease progression or death by 37%  versus chemotherapy  \n• Datopotamab deruxtecan  approved in the U.S. and Japan for same patient population  \n \nTokyo and Munich – (January 31, 2025)  – Datopotamab deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd)  has been recommended \nfor approval in the European Union (EU)  for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic \nhormone receptor (HR)  positive, HER2 negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH- ) breast cancer who have \nreceived endocrine therapy and at least one line of chemotherapy in the advanced setting.  \n \nDatopotamab deruxtecan is a specifically engineered TROP2 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) \ndiscovered by Daiichi Sankyo (TSE:45680) and being jointly developed and commercialized by Daiichi \nSankyo and AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) .   \n The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA)  \nbased its positive opinion on results from the TROPION- Breast01  phase 3 trial  published in the Journal of \nClinical Oncology . The recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission, which has the \nauthority to grant marketing authorizations for medicines in the EU.  \n In TROPION -Breast01 , datopotamab deruxtecan significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or \ndeath by 37% compared to investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR]=0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-0.76; p<0.0001) in patients with HR positive, HER2 negative metastatic breas t cancer as \nassessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Median progression- free survival (PFS) was 6.9 \nmonths in patients treated with datopotamab deruxtecan versus 4.9 months with chemotherapy. A conf irmed \nobjective response rate (ORR) of 36% was observed in the datopotamab deruxtecan arm compared to an ORR of 23% observed in the chemotherapy arm. Two (0.5%) complete responses (CR) and 131 (36%) partial responses (PR) were observed in the datopotamab deruxtecan arm compared to zero CR and 84 PR (23%) in the chemotherapy arm. The median duration of response (DoR) was 6.7 months (95% CI: 5.6-9.8) in the datopotamab deruxtecan arm compared to 5.7 (95% CI: 4.9-6.8) in the chemotherapy arm.  \n Datopotamab deruxtecan demonstrated a favorable safety profile over chemotherapy with no new safety concerns identified. Grade 3 or higher treatment- related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 21% and 45%\n2 of patients in the datopotamab deruxtecan and chemotherapy arms, respectively. The most common grade 3 \nor higher TRAEs were neutropenia (1% vs. 31%), stomatitis (6% vs. 3%), fatigue (2% vs. 2%) and anemia (1% vs. 2%). In the datopotamab deruxtecan arm, the  all-grade interstitial lung disease (ILD) rate was low \n(3%) and the majority of events were low grade. There was one grade 5 ILD event adjudicated as drug  \nrelated by an independent committee. The primary cause of death in this case was attributed to disea se \nprogression by the treating investigator.  \n “Disease progression after endocrine and initial chemotherapy is common in patients with metastatic HR \npositive, HER2 negative breast cancer ,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “This \npositive recommendation by the CHMP for datopotamab deruxtecan, which follows recent approvals in the U.S. and Japan, underscores the potential of this TROP2 directed antibody drug conjugate to offer a new treatment option to patients in the EU with this type of breast cancer .”  \n \n“Only one in three patients live more than five years after a metastatic HR  positive, HER2  negative breast \ncancer diagnosis, underscoring the urgent need for additional effective therapies,” said Susan Galbraith, \nMBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology Hematology R&D, AstraZeneca. “Today’s recommendation for datopotamab deruxtecan bring s us closer to offering these patients in the EU a new and \nneeded alternative to conventional chemotherapy.”  \n Datopotamab deruxtecan is approved in Japan and the U.S. for the treatment of patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer who have received prior endocrine- based therapy and \nchemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease.  Additional regulatory submissions for datopotamab \nderuxtecan in breast cancer are under review in China and other regions.  \n About TROPION -Breast01  \nTROPION -Breast01  is a global, randomized, multicenter, open- label phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and \nsafety of intravenous datopotamab deruxtecan (6 mg/kg) once per 21- day cycle versus investigator’s choice \nof single -agent chemotherapy (eribulin, capecitabine, vinorelbine or gemcitabine) in adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HR positive, HER2 negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breas t cancer who \nhave progressed on and are not suitable for endocrine therapy per investigator assessment and have received at least one prior line of chemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease.  \n \nFollowing disease progression or discontinuation of datopotamab deruxtecan or chemotherapy, patients had \nthe option to receive a subsequent treatment at the discretion of their physician. Crossover between trial arms was not permitted.\n3 The dual primary endpoints of TROPION -Breast01 are PFS as assessed by BICR and OS. Key secondary \nendpoints include objective response rate, duration of response, investigator -assessed PFS, disease control \nrate, time to first subsequent therapy and safety. The PFS data and additional results for key secondary \nendpoints of TROPION -Breast01 were published in  the Journal of Clinical Oncology .  \n \nTROPION -Breast01 enrolled 732 patients in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. For \nmore information visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Hormone Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.1 More than 500,000 breast cancer cases were diagnosed in Europe in 2022.2 While survival rates \nare high for those diagnosed with early breast cancer, only about 30% of patients diagnosed with or who progress to metastatic disease are expected to live five years following diagnosis.\n3  \n \nApproximately 70% of diagnosed cases are considered what has been historically called HR positive, HER2 \nnegative breast cancer (measured as HER2 score of IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -).3 Endocrine therapies \nare widely given consecutively in the early lines of treatment for metastatic HR positive breast cancer.4 \nHowever, after initial treatment , further efficacy from  endocrine t herapy  is often limited .4 The current \nstandard of care following endocrine therapy is chemotherapy, which is associated with poor response rates and outcomes .\n4,5,6,7 \n \nAbout Datopotamab Deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd)  \nDatopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) is an investigational TROP2 directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi \nSankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, datopotamab deruxtecan is one of six DXd ADCs in the \noncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanc ed programs in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific platform. Datopotamab deruxtecan is comprised of a humanized anti -TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal \nantibody, developed in collaboration with Sapporo Medical University, attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payl oads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide- based cleavable linkers.  \n \nDatopotamab deruxtecan is approved in Japan and the U.S. under the brand name DATROWAY for the \ntreatment of adult patients with HR positive, HER2 negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) unresectable \nor recurrent breast cancer after prior chemotherapy based on the results of the TROPION -Breast01  trial.  \n \nAbout the Datopotamab Deruxtecan Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway with more than 20 trials evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan across multiple cancers, including non -small cell lung cancer,\n4 triple negative breast cancer and HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. The program includes eight \nphase 3 trials in lung cancer and five phase 3 trials in breast cancer evaluating datopotamab deruxtecan as a \nmonotherapy and in combination with other anticancer treatments in various settings.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU® in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi \nSankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC.

The median duration of response (DOR) was 14.3 months in the ENHERTU arm ( 95% \nCI: 12.5 -15.9) versus 8.6 months in the chemotherapy arm ( 95% CI: 6.9-11.5) as assessed by BICR.  \n \nIn the HER2 low population (n= 713) (HR 0.6 2; 95% CI: 0.5 2-0.75; p<0.0001) , median PFS was 13.2 months \n(95% CI: 11.4-15.2) in the ENHERTU arm compared to 8. 1 months (95% CI: 7.0-9.0) in the chemotherapy \narm. Confirmed ORR was 62.0% (95% CI: 56.5-67.3) versus 35.2% (95% CI: 30.0 -40.7) in the \nchemotherapy arm. There were 9 (2.8%) CRs and 193 (59.2%) PRs seen in the ENHERTU arm compared to \nzero (0%) CRs and 1 14 (35.2%) PRs in the chemotherapy arm. Median DOR was 14. 1 months (95% CI: \n11.9-15.9) versus 8.6 months (95% CI: 6.7 -11.3)  in the chemotherapy arm . \n \nAn exploratory analysis of the HER2 ultralow population  (n=153)  (HR 0.76; 95% CI: 0.49-1.17)  showed the \nclinically meaningful improvement in PFS was consistent between patients with HER2 low and HER2 \nultralow expression , with 15.1 months (95% CI: 10.0-17.3) reported in the ENHERTU arm and 8.3 months \n(95% CI: 5.8 -15.2) in the chemotherapy arm. Confirmed ORR was 6 5.7% (95% CI: 53.1-76.8) in the \nENHERTU arm and 30.8% (95% CI: 19.9 -43.4) in the chemotherapy arm . Median DOR was 14. 3 months \n(95% CI: 11.8-not estimable  [NE] ) versus 14.1 months  (95% CI: 5.9 -NE) in the chemotherapy arm .  \n \n“Endocrine therapy is typically used in the initial treatment of HR positive metastatic breast cancer and \nfollowing progression , subsequent chemotherapy is associated with poor outcomes ,” said Aditya Bardia, \nMD, MPH,  Program Director of Breast Oncology and Director of Translational Research Integration , UCLA \nHealth Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center  and Investigator in the DESTINY -Breast06  trial. “With a \nmedian progression -free survival exceeding one year and a response rate of more than  60 percen t, \ntrastuzumab deruxtecan offers a potential new standard of care for patients with hormone receptor  positive, \nHER2  low or HER2  ultralow metastatic breast cancer  following endocrine therapy.”  \n \n“We are excited to see more treatment options for these patients which enable more personalized care,” said \nKrissa Smith, V ice President , Education , Susan G. Komen . “It is critical for patients to understand the HER2 \nstatus of their metastatic breast cancer to help them make informed treatment decisions. Patients with tumors \nthat are HER2 low or HER2 ultralow now have more options to consider with their healthcare team.”  \n \nENHERTU  is approved with Boxed WARNINGS for interstitial lung disease (ILD)/ pneumonitis and \nEmbryo -Fetal toxicity. The safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 434 patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 ultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) breast\n3 \n cancer who received ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) in DESTINY -Breast06. The most common (≥20%) adverse \nreactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased white blood cell count, decreased neutrophil \ncount, nausea, decreased hemoglobin, decreased lymphocyte count, fatigue, decreased platelet count, \nalopecia, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased blood alkaline phosphatase, increased asparta te \naminotransferase, decreased blood potassium, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, decreased appetite, COVID -\n19 and musculoskeletal pain.  Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. \nSerious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were ILD/pneumonitis, COVID -19, \nfebrile neutropenia and hypokalemia . Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 2. 8% of patients.   \n \n“ENHERTU continues to redefine the classification and treatment of HR positive metastatic breast cancer \nwith important new data across the spectrum of HER2 expression,” said Ken Keller, Global Head of \nOncology Business, and President and CEO, Daiichi Sanky o, Inc. “Today’s approval underscores our \nongoing commitment to realizing the full potential of this innovative antibody drug conjugate and represents \nanother paradigm shift in how certain breast cancers can be treated.”   \n \n“Building on the practice -changing previous  approvals for ENHERTU , this new approval brings  this \nimportant medicine  to an earlier treatment setting and a broader patient population with HER2  expressing \nmetastatic breast cancer ,” said Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President,  Oncology  Hematology  Business \nUnit, AstraZeneca.  “The approval also highlights the importance of testing metastatic breast cancer tumo rs \nfor detectable staining with a standard IHC test to identify those who may be eligible for treatment with \nENHERTU  following endocrine therapy.”  \n \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca are committed to ensuring that patients in the U.S. who are prescribed \nENHERTU can access the medication and receive necessary financial support. Provider and patient support, \nreimbursement and distribution for ENHERTU in the  U.S. will be accessible by visiting \nwww.ENHERTU4U.com  or calling 1 -833-ENHERTU (1-833-364-3788).  \n  \nPlease visit www.ENHERTU.com  for full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and \nMedication Guide . \n \nFinancial Considerations   \nFollowing this approval in the U.S., an amount of $ 175 million is due from AstraZeneca to Daiichi Sankyo \nas a milestone payment for the HER2 low and HER2 ultralow chemotherapy -naïve breast cancer indication . \nSales of ENHERTU in the U.S. are recognized by Daiichi Sankyo. For further details on the financial \narrangements, please consult the collaboration agreement from March 2019 .  \n \nAbout D ESTINY -Breast06\n4 \n DESTINY -Breast06 is a global, randomized, open -label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) versus investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, paclitaxel or nab \npaclitaxel) in patients with HR positive, HER2 low ( IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 ultralow (defined as \nIHC 0 with membrane staining ) advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients in the trial had no prior \nchemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease and received at least two lines of prior endocrine th erapy in \nthe metastatic setting. Patients also were eligible if they had received one prior line of endocrine therapy \ncombined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the metastatic setting and experienced disease progression within six \nmonths of starting first -line tr eatment or received endocrine therapy as an adjuvant treatment and \nexperienced disease recurrence within 24 months.  \n \nHER2 IHC status was confirmed by a central laboratory and determined based on the most recent evaluable \nHER2 IHC sample prior to randomization. In tumor samples from patients screened for trial eligibility, \nnearly two -thirds of tumors previously assessed a s IHC 0 at a local laboratory were re -classified as HER2 \nlow or HER2 ultralow upon central analysis of the archival tumor sample. It was also observed that \napproximately 85% to 90% patients with HR positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer may have \nactionable levels of HER2 expression.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY -Breast06 is PFS in the HR positive, HER2 low patient population as \nmeasured by BICR. Key secondary endpoints include PFS by BICR in the overall trial population (HER2 \nlow and HER2 ultralow), OS in patients in the HER2 low pa tient population and OS in the overall trial \npopulation. Other secondary endpoints include ORR , DOR , time to first subsequent treatment or death, time \nto second subsequent treatment or death and safety. Analysis of the HER2 ultralow subgroup was not \npowere d to demonstrate statistical significance.  \n \nDESTINY -Breast06 enrolled 866 patients (n=713 for HER2 low and n=153 for HER2 ultralow) in Asia, \nEurope, North America, Oceania and South America. For more information about the trial, visit \nClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Breast Cancer and HER2 Expression  \nBreast  cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.1 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022 with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally.1 In the U.S. , more than 300 ,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually.2 While \nsurvival rates are high for those diagnosed with early breast cancer, only about 30% of patients diagnosed \nwith or who progress to metastatic disease are expected to live five years following diagnosis.3 \n \nHR positive, HER2  negative is the most common breast cancer subtype, accounting for approximately 70% \nof all breast cancers.3 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface\n5 \n of many types of tumors, including breast cancer.4 Patients with high levels of HER2 expression (IHC 3+ or \nIHC2+/ISH+) are classified as HER2 positive and treated with HER2 targeted therapies, representing \napproximately 15 % to 20% of all breast cancers.5 Historically, tumors that were not classified as HER2 \npositive were classified as HER2 negative, despite the fact that many of these tumors still carry some level of \nHER2 expression.6 \n \nEndocrine therap y is widely given consecutively in the early lines of treatment for HR positive metastatic \nbreast cancer. However, after initial  therapy, further efficacy with additional endocrine treatment is often \nlimited. 7 The current standard of care following endocrine therapy is chemotherapy, which is associated with \npoor response rates and outcomes.7,8,9,10 \n \nPrior to the approval s of ENHERTU in HER2 low and HER2 ultralow metastatic breast cancer based on the \nDESTINY -Breast04  and DESTINY -Breast06 trials, there were no targeted therapies approved specifically \nfor these patient populations .11,12  \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 m onoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 75 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or in -situ hybridization \n(ISH)+) breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or \nin the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 75 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior \nsystemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within si x months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S.  for the treatment of adult patients with  unresectable or \nmetastatic  hormone receptor (HR)  positive, HER2  low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2  ultralow (IHC 0 \nwith membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -approved test, that ha s progressed on one \nor more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting  based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast06  trial.\n6 \n  \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 50 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Lung02  and/or DESTINY -Lung05  trials.  Continued approval in China and the U.S. for \nthis indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 65 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) gastric or gastroesophageal \njunction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the re sults \nfrom the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric02  and/or DESTINY -Gastric06  trials. Continued approval \nin China for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a \nconfirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Brazil , Israel, Russ ia and the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic \ntreatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options based on efficacy results from the \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 , DESTINY -Lung01  and DESTINY -CRC02  trials. Continued approval for this \nindication in the U.S. may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a \nconfirmatory trial . \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global  clinical  development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers. Trials in combination with other \nanticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU  in March 2019  and DATROWAY® in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of \nENHERTU  and DATROWAY.  \n \nAbout the ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two distinct \nADC technology platforms discovered in -house by Daiichi Sankyo.\n7 \n The ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC Technology where each \nADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an \nexatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleava ble linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently \nconsists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and DATROWAY,  a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being \njointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a \nHER3 directed ADC , ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd), a B7 -H3 directed ADC, and raludotatug deruxtecan \n(R-DXd), a CDH6 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with Merck & \nCo., Inc, Rahway, NJ, USA . DS-3939, a TA -MUC1 directed ADC, is being developed by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe second Daiichi Sankyo ADC platform consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a modified \npyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) payload. DS -9606, a CLDN6 directed PBD ADC, is the first of several \nplanned ADCs in clinical development utilizing this platform.  \n \nIfinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan, raludotatug deruxtecan, DS -3939 and DS -9606 are \ninvestigational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy \nhave not been established.  \n \nENHERTU U.S. Important Safety Information   \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC 3+ or ISH positive) breast cancer who have received \na prior anti -HER2 -based regimen either:  \n– In the metastatic setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six  \nmonths of completing therapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic:  \n– Hormone receptor (HR) -positive, HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 -ultralow (IHC 0 \nwith membrane staining) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -approved test, that has progressed \non one or more endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting  \n– HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -approved test, who \nhave received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during \nor within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 \n(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA -approved test, and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration \nof response.

Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and \ndescription of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, \ndyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue \nENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk \nand to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of \nthese risks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life -threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Cons ider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose 1 level . Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (range: \n0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonit is occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with \nENHERTU.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: \n1.2 to 21).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor\n9 \n complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 \nx 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), i nterrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by 1 level.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Nineteen percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time t o first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 \ndays (range: 2 to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.2% of patients.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty -one percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Media n time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 \ndays (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is 20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. \nIf LVEF of 20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \npatients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHER TU has not been studied in \npatients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 4.6% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3 or 4.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive poten tial to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and  for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until  \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by 1 level.\n10 \n Adverse Reactions  \nHER2 -Positive, HER2 -Low, and HER2 -Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer , HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and \nSolid Tumors (Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \n2233 patients in Study DS8201 -A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast02, \nDESTINYBreast03, DESTINY -Breast04, DESTINY -Breast06, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY -Lung02, \nDESTINY -CRC02, and DESTINY -PanTumor02.

Advise patients \nof the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant \nwomen, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last d ose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions \nin a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during tre atment with ENHERTU and for 7 months \nafter the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing : Verify pregnancy status of females \nof reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : ENHERTU can \ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to \nuse effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 1741 patients with HER2 -positive, HER2 -low, or HER2 -ultralow breast cancer \ntreated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 24% were ≥65 years and 4.9% were ≥75 years. No overall \ndifferences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 year s of age compared \nto younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients \naged ≥65 years (61%) as compared to younger patients (52%). Of the 101 patients with HER2 -mutant \nunresectable or metastat ic NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% \nwere ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of \nage compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with HER2 -positive locally adv anced or \nmetastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, \n56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed \nbetween patients ≥65 years of age compared to young er patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2 -positive \n(IHC 3+) unresectable or metastatic solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -\nPanTumor02, DESTINY -Lung01, or DESTINY -CRC02, 39% were ≥65 years and 9% were ≥75 years. \nNo overall differences in  efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared \nto younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min) . \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe h epatic\n14 impairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA -1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the \nworld.

DATROWAY is the second DXd ADC  approved in the U.S.  based on  Daiichi \nSankyo’s DXd ADC T echnology.   \nT\nhe approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  (FDA)  was based on results from the TROPION-\nBreast01  phase 3 trial. In the trial, DATROWAY significantly reduc ed the risk  of disease progression or \ndeath by 37% compared to investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR]=0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52 -0.76 ; p<0.0001) in patients with HR positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer as \nassessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Median progression -free survival  (PFS)  was 6.9 \nmonths in patients treated with DATROWAY versus 4.9 months with chemotherapy. A confirmed objective \nresponse rate (ORR) of 36% was observed in the DATROWAY arm compared to an ORR of 23 % observed \nin the chemotherapy arm . Two (0.5%) complete responses (CR) and  131 (36%)  partial responses (PR) were \nobserved in the DATROWAY arm com pared to zero CR and 84 PR (23%) in the chemotherapy arm.  The \nmedia n duration of response (DoR)  was 6.7 months (95% CI: 5.6 -9.8) in the DATROWAY arm compared to \n5.7 (95% CI: 4.9 -6.8) in the chemotherapy arm.  \n“Desp\nite considerable progress in the HR  positive, HER2  negative metastatic breast cancer treatment \nlandscape, new therapies are still needed to tackle the frequent and complex challenge of disease progression  \nafter endocrine and initial chemotherapy ,” said Aditya Bardia, MD, MPH, Program Director of Breast \nOncology and Director of Translational Research Integration  at the  UCLA Health  Jonsson Comprehensive \nCancer Center and Global Principal Investigator for TROPION -Breast0 1. “The approval of datopotamab\n2 deruxtecan , a novel TROP2 directed antibody drug conjugate,  marks a major therapeutic milestone and \nprovides  patients with  metastatic breast cancer a new treatment alternative to conventional chemotherapy. ”  \n \n“Only one in three  patients  with metastatic HR positive, HER2  negative breast cancer live more than  five \nyears following diagnosis , highlighting the urgent need for  additional  effective therapies,” said Caitlin Lewis, \nSenior Vice President  of Strategy & Mission, Living Beyond Breast Cancer . “The approval of DATROWAY \nis a significant advance, offering patients with metastatic HR positive  breast cancer  a new and much  needed \ntreatment option. ”  \n \nIn TROPION -Breast01 , the safety of  DATROWAY (6 mg/kg) was evaluated in  360 patients . The  most \ncommon (>20%) adverse reactions,  including  laboratory abnormalities, were stomatitis, nausea, fatigue, \ndecreased leukocytes, decreased calcium, alopecia, decreased lymphocytes, decreased hemoglobin, \nconstipation, decreased neutrophils,  dry eye , increased alanine transaminase, vomiting, increased  aspartate \naminotransferase, increased alkaline phosphatase, and keratitis. Serious adverse reactions among patients \nwho received DATROWAY included urinary tract infection (1. 9%), COVID-19 infection (1.7%),  interstitial \nlung disease (ILD) /pneumonitis  (1.1%), acute kidney injury (0.6%), pulmonary embolism (0.6%),  vomiting \n(0.6%), diarrhea (0.6%) , hemiparesis (0.6%),  and anemia (0.6%). One patient f atality  (0.3%) was attributed  \nto an adverse reaction  (ILD /pneumonitis ).  \n \n“The approval of DATROWAY provides patients with HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer  previously \ntreated with  endocrine -based therapy and traditional chemotherapy with the opportunity to be treated with a  \nnew TROP2 directed antibody drug conjugate  earlier in the metastatic setting ,” said Ken Keller, Global Head \nof Oncology Business, and President and CEO, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. “ DATROWAY is the latest addition to \nour portfolio of innovative cancer treatments and marks the fourth medicine from our oncology pipeline to \nreceive approval in the U.S. ”  \n “With this first approval of DATROWAY  in the U.S., we continue to deliver on our ambition for antibody \ndrug conjugates to improve upon and replace conventional chemotherapy  for the treatment of multiple \ncancers,” said Dave Fredrickson , Executive Vice President, Oncology Hematology Business Unit, \nAstraZeneca. “ We are proud to bring DATROWAY  to people living with metastatic HR positive, HER2 \nnegative breast cancer , and this approval marks the eighth new medicine of the 20 we have set out to deliver \nacross AstraZeneca by 2030. ”  \n \nDATROWAY will be available by prescription in the U.S. in approximately two weeks. Daiichi Sankyo and \nAstraZeneca are committed to ensuring that patients in the U.S. who are prescribed DATROWAY can access \nthe medication and receive necessary financial support. Provider and patient support, reimbursement and\n3 distribution for DATROWAY in the U.S. will be accessible by visiting Datroway4u.com  or calling 1 -855-\nDAT -RO4U (1 -855- 328-7648).  \n  \nAdditional regulatory submissions for DATROWAY in breast cancer are under review in the EU, China and \nother regions.  \n \nPlease visit www.DATROWAY.com  for full Prescribing Information, including the Medication Guide . \n About TROPION- Breast 01 \nTROPION- Breast01  is a global, randomized, multicenter, open-label phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and \nsafety of intravenous DATROWAY (6 mg/kg) once per 21-day cycle versus investigator’s choice of single -\nagent chemotherapy (eribulin, capecitabine, vinorelbine or gemcitabine) in adult patients  with unresectable \nor metastatic HR positive, HER2 negative (IHC 0 , IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have \nprogressed on and are not suitable for endocrine therapy per investigator assessment and have received at least one prior line  of chemo therapy for unresectable or metastatic disease.  \n \nFollowing disease progression or discontinuation of DATROWAY or chemotherapy, patients had the option \nto receive a subsequent treatment at the discretion of their physician. Crossover between trial arms was not \npermitted. \n The dual primary endpoints of TROPION -Breast01 are PFS as assessed by BICR and OS. Key secondary \nendpoints include ORR , duration of response, investigator -assessed PFS, disease control rate, time to first \nsubsequent therapy and safety. The PFS data and additional results for key secondary endpoints of TROPION- Breast01 were published in the  Journal of Clinical Oncology .  \n \nTROPION- Breast01 enrolled 732 patients in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. For \nmore information visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Hormone Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative  Breast Cancer  \nIn the U.S., more than 300,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually .\n1 While survival rates are high \nfor those diagnosed with early breast cancer, only about 30% of patients diagnosed with or who progress to \nmetastatic disease are expected to live five years following diagnosis.2  \n Approximately 70% of diagnosed cases are considered what has been historically called HR positive, HER2 \nnegative breast cancer  (measured as HER2 score of IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-).\n2 Endocrine therapies \nare widely given consecutively in the early lines of treatment for HR positive metastatic breast cancer.3\n4 However, after initial treatment, further efficacy from  endocrine t herapy  is often limited.3 The current \nstandard of care following endocrine therapy is chemotherapy, which is associated with poor response rates \nand outcomes.3,4,5,6  \n About DATROWAY  \nDATROWAY (datopotamab deruxtecan -dlnk) is a TROP2 directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s \nproprietary DXd ADC Technology, DATROWAY is one of six DXd ADCs in the oncology pipeline of \nDaiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanced programs in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. \nDATROWAY is comprised of a humanized anti -TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, developed in \ncollaboration with Sapporo Medical University, attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide-based cleavable linkers.   \nDATROWAY (6 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HR positive, HER2 negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) breast cancer who \nhave received prior endocrine-based therapy and chemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease based \non the  results from the TROPION- Breast01  trial. \n About the DATROWAY Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway with more than 20 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of DATROWAY across multiple cancers, including non -small cell lung cancer , triple \nnegative breast cancer and HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. The program includes seven phase 3 \ntrials in lung cancer and five phase 3 trials in breast cancer evaluating DATROWAY as a monotherapy and \nin combination with other anticancer treatments in various settings. \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU\n® in March 2019 and DATROWAY in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of  \nENHERTU and DATROWAY.    \n \nAbout the ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two distinct \nADC technology platforms discovered in-house by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC Technology where each \nADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an\n5 exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide-based cleavable linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently \nconsists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and DATROWAY,  a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being \njointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a \nHER3 directed ADC, ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd), a B7 -H3 directed ADC, and raludotatug deruxtecan \n(R-DXd), a CDH6 di rected ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with Merck & \nCo., Inc, Rahway, NJ, USA. DS -3939, a TA -MUC1 directed ADC, is being developed by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n \nThe second Daiichi Sankyo ADC platform consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a modified \npyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) payload. DS -9606, a CLDN6 directed PBD ADC, is the first of several \nplanned ADCs in clinical development utilizing this platform.  \nIfinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan, raludotatug deruxtecan, DS -3939 and DS -9606 are \ninvestigational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy \nhave not been established.  \n \nDATROWAY U.S. Important Safety Information  \nIndication \nDATROWAY\n® is a T rop-2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the \ntreatment of adult  patients with unresectable or metastatic, hormone receptor (HR )-positive, HER2 negative \n(IHC 0, IHC 1+ , or IHC 2+/ISH−) breast cancer who have received prior endocrine-based therapy and \nchemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic disease.  \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n Warnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis  \nDATROWAY can cause severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis.  \n In TROPION -Breast01, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 4.2% of patients treated with DATROWAY, including \n0.5% of patients with Grade 3 -4 ILD/pneumonitis, and 0.3% with fatal ILD/pneumonitis. Six patients (1.7%) \npermanently discontinued DATROWAY due to ILD/pneumonitis. The median time -to-onset of \nILD/pneumonitis was 3.5 months (range: 1.2 months to 10.8 months). Patients were excluded from TROPION- Breast01 for a history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring treatment with steroids or for ongoing \nILD/pneumonitis. \n \nMonitor patients for new or worsening respiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (eg, dyspnea, \ncough, fever) during treatment with DATROWAY. For asymptomatic (Grade 1) ILD/pneumonitis, consider \ncorticosteroid treatment (eg, ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisol one or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis \n(Grade 2 or greater), promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment (eg, ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nWithhold DATROWAY in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue \nDATROWAY if Grade ≥ 2 ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed.\n6 Ocular Adverse Reactions \nDATROWAY can cause ocular adverse reactions including dry eye, keratitis, blepharitis, meibomian gland \ndysfunction, increased lacrimation, conjunctivitis, and blurred vision.  \n \nIn TROPION -Breast01, ocular adverse reactions occurred in 51% of patients treated with DATROWAY. \nSeven patients (1.9%) experienced Grade 3 ocular adverse reactions, including dry eye, keratitis, and blurred vision. The most common (≥5%) ocular adverse reac tions were dry eye (27%), keratitis (24%), blepharitis \nand increased lacrimation (8% each), and meibomian gland dysfunction (7%). Patients with clinically \nsignificant corneal disease were excluded from TROPION-Breast01.  \n \nThe median time to onset for ocular adverse reactions was 2.1 months (range: 0.03 months to 23.2 months). \nOf the patients who experienced ocular adverse reactions, 45% had complete resolution; 9% had partial improvement (defined as a decrease in severity b y one or more grades from the worst grade at last follow \nup). Ocular adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of DATROWAY in 0.8% of patients.  \nAdvise patients to use preservative-free lubricant eye drops several times daily for prophylaxis. Advise patients to avoid use of contact lenses unless directed by an eye care professional.  \n \nRefer patients to an eye care professional for an ophthalmic exam including visual acuity testing, slit lamp \nexamination (with fluorescein staining), intraocular pressure, and fundoscopy at treatment initiation, annually \nwhile on treatment, at end of treat ment, and as clinically indicated.  \n Promptly refer patients to an eye care professional for any new or worsening ocular adverse reactions. \nMonitor patients for ocular adverse reactions during treatment with DATROWAY, and if diagnosis is \nconfirmed, dose delay, dose reduce, or permanently disc ontinue DATROWAY based on severity.  \n \nStomatitis  \nDATROWAY can cause stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis.  \n In the TROPION-Breast01 study, stomatitis occurred in 59% of patients treated with DATROWAY, \nincluding 7% of patients with Grade 3-4 events. Median time to first onset was 0.7 months (range: 0.03 \nmonths to 8.8 months). Stomatitis led to interruption of DATROWAY in 1.9%, dosage reductions in 13%, \nand permanent discontinuation in 0.3% of patients.  \n In patients who received DATROWAY, 38% used a mouthwash containing corticosteroid for management \nor prophylaxis of stomatitis/oral mucositis at any time during the treatment.  \n \nAdvise patients to use a steroid -containing mouthwash for prophylaxis and treatment of stomatitis. Instruct \nthe patient to hold ice chips or ice water in the mouth throughout the infusion of DATROWAY.   \nMonitor patients for signs and symptoms of stomatitis. If stomatitis occurs, increase the frequency of \nmouthwash and administer other topical treatments as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of the \nadverse reaction, withhold, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue DATROWAY.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nBased on its mechanism of action, DATROWAY can cause embryo -fetal harm when administered to a \npregnant woman because the topoisomerase inhibitor component of DATROWAY, DXd, is genotoxic and affects actively dividing cells.   \nAdvise patients of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use \neffective contraception during treatment with DATROWAY and for 7 months after the last dose. Advise \nmale patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment \nwith DATROWAY and for 4 months after the last dose.\n7 Adverse Reactions \nThe safety of DATROWAY was evaluated in 360 patients with unresectable or metastatic HR -positive, \nHER2 -negative (IHC 0, IHC  1+ or IHC  2+/ISH−) breast cancer who received at least one dose of \nDATROWAY 6 mg/kg in TROPION- Breast01. DATROWAY was administered by intravenous infusion \nonce every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 6.7 months (range: 0.7 months to 16.1 months) for patients who received DATROWAY.  \n Serious adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients who received DATROWAY. Serious adverse reactions \nin >0.5% of patients who received DATROWAY were urinary tract infection (1.9%), COVID19 infection \n(1.7%), ILD/pneumonitis (1.1%), acute kidney injury, pulmonary embolism, vomiting, diarrhea, hemiparesis, and anemia (0.6% each). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 0.3% of patients who received DATROWAY and were due to ILD/pneumonitis.  \n \nPermanent discontinuation of DATROWAY due to an adverse reaction occurred in 3.1% of patients. \nAdverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of DATROWAY in >0.5% of patients included ILD/pneumonitis (1. 7%) and fatigue (0.6%). Dosage interruptions of DATROWAY due to an \nadverse reaction occurred in 22% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in >1% of patients included COVID-19 (3.3%), infusion-related reaction (1.4%), ILD/pneumoni tis (1.9%), stomatitis \n(1.9%), fatigue (1.7%), keratitis (1.4%), acute kidney injury (1.1%), and pneumonia  (1.1%).  Dose reductions \nof DATROWAY due to an adverse reaction occurred in 23% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose reduction in >1% of patients included stomatitis (13%), fatigue (3.1%), nausea (2.5%), and weight decrease (1.9%).  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were stomatitis (59%), \nnausea (56%), fatigue (44%), decreased leukocytes (41%), decreased calcium (39%), alopecia (38%), \ndecreased lymphocytes (36%), decreased hemoglobin (35%), constipation (34%), decreased neutrophils (30%), dry eye (27%),  vomiting (24%),  increased ALT (24%),  keratitis (24%) , increased AST (23%),  and \nincreased alkaline phosphatase (23%) . \n \nClinically relevant adverse reactions occurring in <10% of patients who received DATROWAY included \ninfusion-related reactions (including bronchospasm), ILD/pneumonitis, headache, pruritus, dry skin, dry mouth, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, meibomian gland d ysfunction, blurred vision, increased lacrimation , \nphotophobia, visual impairment, skin hyperpigmentation, and madarosis.  \n Use in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy: Based on its mechanism of action, DATROWAY can cause embryo -fetal harm when \nadministered to a pregnant woman because the topoisomerase inhibitor component of DATROWAY, DXd, is genotoxic and affects actively dividing cells. There are no available data on th e use of \nDATROWAY in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus.  \n• Lactation: There are no data regarding the presence of datopotamab deruxtecan -dlnk or its \nmetabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. \nBecause of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, ad vise women not to \nbreastfeed during treatment with DATROWAY and for 1 month after the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Pregnancy Testing: Verify pregnancy status of \nfemales of reproductive potential prior to initiation of DATROWAY. Contraception: Females: \nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with \nDATROWAY and for 7 months after the last dose. Males: Because of the potential for genotoxicity, \nadvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DATROWAY and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : Based on \nfindings in animal toxicity studies, DATROWAY may impair male and female reproductive function and fertility. The effects on reproductive organs in animals were irreversible.\n8 • Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of DATROWAY have not been established in pediatric \npatients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 365 patients in TROPION -Breast01 treated with DATROWAY 6 mg/kg, 25% \nwere ≥65 years of age and 5% were ≥75 years of age. Grade ≥3 and serious adverse reactions were \nmore common in patients ≥65 years (42% and 25%, respectively) compared to patients <6 5 years \n(33% and 15%, respectively). In TROPION -Breast01, no other meaningful differences in safety or \nefficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years of age versus younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment: A higher incidence of ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 30 to <90 mL/min). Monitor patients with renal impairment for increased adverse reactions, including respiratory reacti ons. No dosage \nadjustment is recommended in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of severe \nrenal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) on the pharmacokinetics of datopotamab deruxtecan-dlnk or \nDXd is unknown.  \n• Hepatic Impairment: No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild  hepatic \nimpairment  (total bilirubin ≤ULN and any AST >ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN and \nany AST). Limited data are available in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin \n>1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST). Monitor patients with moderate hepatic impairment for \nincreased adverse reactions . The recommended dosage of DATROWAY has not been established for \npatients with severe hepatic impairment  (total biliru bin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA-1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information, including the Medication Guide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the \nworld.

    "content": "1 \n \n \n \nPress Release  \n \nDATROWAY® Approved in Japan as the First TROP -2 Directed \nTherapy for Patients  with Previously Treated Unresectable or \nRecurrent HR Positive, HER2 Negative Breast Cancer  \n \n• First global approval  based on TROPION -Breast01 where DATROWAY  significantly reduced the risk \nof disease progression or death by 37% versus  chemotherapy   \n• Second DXd antibody drug conjugate  approved in Japan based on Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd technology  \n \nTokyo – (December  27, 2024 ) – Daiichi Sankyo’s (TSE:4568) DATROWAY® (datopotamab deruxtecan)  \nhas been approved in Japan for the treatment of adult patients with hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 \nnegative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) unresectable or recurrent breast cancer after prior chemotherapy.  \n \nIn Japan, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women.1 Approximately 92,000 cases of breast cancer \nwere diagnosed in Japan in 2022, with approximately  17,600 deaths.1 It is estimated that 70% of diagnosed \ncases are considered what has been historically called HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer (measured \nas HER2 score of IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -).2 \n \nDATROWAY is the first ever TROP -2 directed medicine to be approved in Japan  for HR positive, HER2 \nnegative breast cancer  and is the second DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) approved based on Daiichi \nSankyo’s DXd ADC Technology .  \n \nThe approval of DATROWAY by the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) is based on \nresults from the TROPION -Breast01  phase 3 trial . In this trial , DATROWAY  significantly  reduc ed the risk \nof disease progression or death by 37% compared to investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (hazard ratio  \n[HR] =0.63, 95% confidence interval  [CI]: 0.52 -0.76; p<0.0001 ) in patients with HR positive, HER2 negative \nmetastatic breast cancer as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) . Median  progression -free \nsurvival  (PFS) was 6.9 months in patients treated with DATROWAY compared to 4.9 months in those \ntreated with chemotherapy .  \n \n“This first global approval of DATROWAY provides patients in Japan with metastatic HR positive, HER2 \nnegative breast cancer a new alternative to conventional chemotherapy, which is often associated with poor \nresponse rates, ” said Wataru Takasaki, PhD, Senior Advis or, Daiichi Sankyo . “DATROWAY also is  the \nsecond DXd antibody drug conjugate approved  in Japan based on technology invented by Daiichi Sankyo , \nemphasizing our commitment to creating new , innovative standards of care for patients with cancer.”\n2 \n  \nIn TROPION -Breast01, adverse reactions occurred in 93.6% (337/360 patients ) of the 360 patients \n(including 31 Japanese patients) in the DATROWAY (6 mg/kg)  arm. The most common adverse reactions \nincluded nausea (51.1%), stomatitis (50.0%), alopecia (36.4% ), fatigue (23.6% ), and dry eye (21.7% ). In \nJapanese patients, interstitial lung disease  (ILD) occurred in 6.5% of patients treated with DATROWAY.  \n \nDATROWAY  is approved in Japan with a Warning for ILD. As cases of ILD, including fatal cases, have  \noccurred in DATROWA Y-treated patients . DATROWAY  is to be used in close collaboration with a \nrespiratory  disease expert. Patients should be closely observed during therapy by monitoring for early signs \nor symptoms  of ILD (such as dyspnea, cough or fever) and performing periodical  percutaneous oxygen \nsaturation (SpO 2) tests, chest X -ray scans and chest CT scans. If abnormalities are observed, discontinue \nadministration of  DATROWAY  and take appropriate measures, such as corticosteroid administration. Prior \nto initiation of  DATROWAY  therapy, a chest CT scan should be performed and medical history taken to \nconfirm the absence  of any comorbidity or history of ILD with the patient and carefully consider the \neligibility of the patient for  DATROWAY  therapy.  \n \nAdditional regulatory submissions for DATROWAY in breast  cancer are under  review in the EU, China , \nU.S. and other regions.   \n \nAbout TROPION -Breast 01 \nTROPION -Breast01  is a global, randomized, multicenter, open -label phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and \nsafety of intravenous  DATROWAY  (6 mg/kg) once per 21 -day cycle  versus investigator’s choice of single -\nagent chemotherapy (eribulin, capecitabine, vinorelbine or gemcitabine) in adult patients  with unresectable \nor metastatic HR positive, HER2 negative (IHC 0 , IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who progressed on \nand are not suitable for endocrine therapy per investigator assessment and have received at least one \nadditional systemic therapy for unresectable or metastatic disease.   \n \nFollowing disease progression or discontinuation of DATROWAY  or chemotherapy, patients had the option \nto receive subsequent treatment at the discretion of their physician . Crossover between trial arms was not \npermitted.  \n \nThe dual primary endpoints of TROPION -Breast01 are PFS as assessed by BICR and overall survival . Key \nsecondary endpoints include overall response rate , duration of response, investigator -assessed PFS, disease \ncontrol rate, time to first subsequent therapy and safety. The PFS data and additional results for key \nsecondary endpoints of TROPION -Breast01 were published in the  Journal of Clinical Oncology .\n3 \n TROPION -Breast01 enrolled 7 32 patients in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. For \nmore information visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Hormone Receptor Positive , HER2 Negative  Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.3 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022 with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally.3 In Japan, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with approximately 92,000 \ncases of breast cancer diagnosed in 2022.1 While survival rates are high for those diagnosed with early breast \ncancer, only about 30% of patients diagnosed with or who progress to metastatic disease are expected to live \nfive years following diagnosis.2 \n \nApproximately 70 % of diagnosed cases are considered what has been  historically called HR positive, HER2 \nnegative breast cancer  (measured as HER2 score of IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -).2 Endocrine therapies \nare widely given consecutively in the early lines of treatment for HR positive metastatic breast cancer .4 \nHowever, after initial treatment , further efficacy from  endocrine therapy  is often limited .4 The current \nstandard of care following endocrine therapy is chemotherapy, which is associated with poor response rates \nand outcomes.4,5,6,7 \n \nAbout DATROWAY   \nDATROWAY (datopotamab deruxtecan) is a TROP -2 directed ADC.  Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s \nproprietary DXd ADC Technology, DATROWAY is one of six DXd ADCs in the oncology pipeline of \nDaiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanced programs in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. \nDATROWAY is comprised of a humanized anti -TROP -2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, developed in \ncollaboration with Sapporo Medical University, attached to a number of topoisomerase I  inhibitor payloads \n(an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n \nDATROWAY (6 mg/kg) is approved in Japan for the treatment of adult patients with HR  positive, HER2  \nnegative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) unresectable or recurrent breast cancer after prior chemotherapy  \nbased on results from the TROPION -Breast01  trial.  \n \nAbout the DATROWAY Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway with more than 20 trials evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of DATROWAY  across multiple cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, triple \nnegative breast cancer , and HR positive, HER2 low or negative breast cancer . The program includes seven  \nphase 3 trials in lung cancer and five phase 3 trials in breast cancer evaluating DATROW AY as a \nmonotherapy and in combination with other anticancer treatments in various settings.\n4 \n  \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU® in March 2019  and DATROWAY  in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of \nENHERTU  and DATROWAY . \n \nAbout the ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two distinct \nADC technology platforms discovered in -house by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n  \nThe ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd  ADC Technology where each \nADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an \nexatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently \nconsists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and DATROWAY,  a TROP -2 directed ADC, which are \nbeing jointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -\nDXd), a HER3 directed ADC, ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd), a B7 -H3 directed ADC, and raludotatug \nderuxtecan (R -DXd), a CDH6 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with \nMerck & Co., Inc, Rahway, NJ, USA . DS-3939, a TA -MUC1 directed ADC, is being developed by Daiichi \nSankyo.  \n \nThe second Daiichi Sankyo ADC platform consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a modified \npyrrolobenzodiazepine ( PBD ) payload. DS -9606, a CLDN6 directed PBD ADC, is the first of several \nplanned ADCs in clinical development utilizing this platform.  \n  \nIfinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan , raludotatug deruxtecan, DS -3939 and DS -9606 are \ninvestigational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy \nhave not been established.  \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi  Sankyo  is an innovative  global  healthcare  company  contributing  to the sustainable  development  of \nsociety  that discovers,  develops  and delivers  new standards  of care to enrich  the quality  of life around  the \nworld.

Full \napproval of this indication will depend on the clinical benefit of the confirmatory trial. \n \nENHERTU is  a specifically engineered HER2  directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by \nDaiichi Sankyo and being jointly developed and commerciali zed by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca.  \n Approximately 2% to 4% of patients with NSCLC have tumors with HER2 mutations.\n1,2 More than 40%  of \nthe global cases of lung cancer occur in Chin a, with approximately one  million new cases and 733,000 deaths \nreported in 2022.3,4 The prognosis is particularly poor for patients with NSCLC, the most common form of \nlung cancer, and the majority of patients are diagnosed with  advanced disease.5  \n The conditional approval by China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) is based on results \nfrom the  DESTINY -Lung02 and DESTINY -Lung05 phase 2 trial s.  \n \nIn DESTINY -Lung02, which included patients from Japan, Korea and Taiwan, ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) \ndemonstrated strong and durable tumor responses in patients with HER2  mutant metastatic NSCLC who had \nreceived at least one regimen of prior anticancer therapy that must have contained a platinum-based chemotherapy. In the trial, confirmed overall response rate (ORR) was 49.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 39.0-59.1) with one complete response (CR) and 49 partial responses (PRs), as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Median duration of response (DOR) was 16.8 months (95% CI: 6.4-not\n2 \n evaluable [NE] ). Median progression -free survival ( PFS) was 9.9 months (95% CI: 7.4- NE) and median \noverall survival (OS) was 19.5 months (95% CI: 13.6- NE).  \n \nIn DESTINY -Lung05, ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg)  demonstrated  a clinically meaningful response in patients in \nChina with HER2  mutant metastatic NSCLC with disease progression on or after at least one prior anticancer \ntherapy. Treatment with ENHERTU resulted in a confirmed ORR of 58.3% (95% CI: 46.1- 69.8), as assessed \nby independent central review (ICR) with one CR and 41 PRs . The results of DESTINY -Lung05 are \nconsistent with the efficacy results of the global DESTINY -Lung02 phase 2 trial.  \n “While there have been many advancements in the  treatment of non -small cell lung cancer in China in recent \nyears, those with HER2  mutant disease have had few treatment options and none directed towards this \nspecific type of lung cancer,” said Ying Cheng, MD , PhD, Director of Jilin Lung Cancer  Centre , China  and \nprincipal investigator of DESTINY -Lung05. “This approval of ENHERTU offers an important new targeted \ntreatment for patients with this aggressive form of disease.”  \n “Since our initial approval of ENHERTU for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer in China last year, we have remained committed to bringing this innovative antibody drug conjugate to more patients \nin China, especially those that have previou sly not been eligible for treatment with a HER2 directed \ntherapy,” said Kiminori Nagao, Head of the Asia, South and Central America Business Unit, Daiichi Sankyo. “Today’s milestone marks the fourth approval of ENHERTU in China and follows the recent approval for HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer, reinforcing its benefit across multiple HER2 targetable tumors.”  \n “This approval of ENHERTU represents the first HER2 directed therapy approved in China for the treatment \nof HER2  mutant metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, marking an important step forward in how the disease \ncan be treated ,” said Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, AstraZeneca. “It  \nalso reinforces the importance of testing for predictive biomarkers, including HER2  mutation s in lung cancer \nat the time of diagnosis to ensure patients  can receive the most appropriate treatment for their specific \ndisease.”   \n \nThe safety profiles of ENHERTU in DESTINY -Lung02 and DESTINY -Lung05 were similar and generally \nconsistent with previous clinical trials of ENHERTU in lung cancer with no new safety concerns identified. \nGrade 3 or grade 4 treatment related adverse events fr om a pooled safety analysis of patients treated with \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) across multiple tumor types in clinical studies included neutropenia (17.0%), anemia (9.5%), fatigue (8.4%), leukopenia (6.4%), nausea (5.9%), thrombocytopenia (5.0%), lymphopenia (4.8%), hypokalemia (3.8%), transaminases increased (3.6%), vomiting (2.7%), diarrhea (2.0%), decreased appetite (1.7%), pneumonia (1.4%) and ejection fraction decreased (1.1%). Grade 5 adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% of patients, including interstitial lung disease  (ILD) (1.0%). Discontinuation of treatment due to an\n3 \n adverse event  occurred in 13% of patients. The most frequent adverse event associated with permanent \ndiscontinuation was ILD (9.2%).   \n \nAbout  DESTINY- Lung02   \nDESTINY -Lung02 is a global, randomized phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU in \npatients with HER2  mutant unresectable and/or metastatic NSCLC with disease recurrence or progression \nduring or after at least one regimen of prior anticancer therapy that must have contained a platinum -based \nchemotherapy. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg (n=102) or ENHERTU  6.4 mg/kg (n=50).   The primary endpoint of the trial is confirmed ORR as assessed by BICR . Secondary endpoints include \ndisease control rate ( DCR ), DOR and PFS assessed by investigator and BICR, OS and safety. DESTINY -\nLung02 enrolled 152 patients at multiple sites  in Asia, Europe, North America  and Oceania. For more \ninformation about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n About  DESTINY- Lung05  \nDESTINY -Lung05 is a n open -label, single -arm phase 2 trial in China evaluating the safety and efficacy of \nENHERTU ( 5.4 mg/kg) in patients with HER2  mutant  metastatic NSCLC  with disease progression on or \nafter at least one prior anticancer therapy . \n The primary endpoint of the trial is confirmed ORR  as assessed by ICR . Secondary endpoints include \ninvestigator -assessed confirmed ORR , and  ICR and investigator -assessed D OR, DCR , PFS and safety. \nDESTINY -Lung05 enrolled 72 patients at multiple sites in China. For more information about the trial, visit \nclinicaltrials.gov . \n About  HER2  Mutant  NSCLC            \nLung cancer is the most common cancer globally and is the leading cause of cancer -related death  in both \nmen and women.\n4 Nearly 2.5 million cases of lung cancer were  diagnosed  in 2022 , with 1.8 million  deaths \nreported globally.4 Prognosis is particularly poor for patients with metastatic NSCLC as only approximately \n9% will live beyond five years after diagnosis.6 \n Incidence rates for lung cancer are markedly higher in Asia, particularly in China, where more than 40%  of \nall global cases occur .\n3,4 Lung cancer is the most common cancer in China with more than one million  new \ncases diagnosed in 2022 .3 Additionally, it  is the leading cause of cancer -related death in China , with more \nthan 733,000 deaths reported in 2022.3 Approximately 68% of patients in China present with advanced \ndisease at the time of diagnosis.7\n4 \n HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of multiple tumor \ntypes . Certain HER2 ( ERBB2 ) gene alterations (called HER2  mutations) have been identified in patients with \nnon squamous NSCLC as a distinct molecular target, and occur in approximately 2% to 4% of patients with \nthis type of lung cancer .1,2 While HER2  gene mutations can occur in a range of patients, they are more \ncommonly found in patients with NSCLC who are younger, female and have never smoked.8 HER2 gene \nmutations have been independently associated with cancer cell growth and poor prognosis, with an increased incidence of brain metastases .\n9 Next -generation sequencing has been utilized in the identification of HER2  \n(ERBB2 ) mutations.10 \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 m onoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 65 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive ( immunohistochemistry [ IHC] 3+ or in -situ hybridization \n(ISH)+) breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or \nin the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy base d on the results from the DESTINY- Breast03  trial.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 65 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior \nsystemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within si x months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 45 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2 ( ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Lung02 and/or DESTINY -Lung05 trials . Continued approval in China and the U.S. for \nthis indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 45 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+)\n gastric or gastroesophageal \njunction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab- based regimen based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric0 2 and/or DESTINY -Gastric06  trials.  Continued approval\n5 \n in China for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a \nconfirmatory trial.   ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic treatment and have no \nsatisfactory alternative treatment options based on efficacy results from the DESTINY -PanTumor02, \nDESTINY -Lung01 \nand DESTINY -CRC02  trials. Continued approval for this indication in the U.S. may be \ncontingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. \n About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program A comprehensive global clinical  development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers.

Patients in the trial had  no prior chemotherapy for \nadvanced or metastatic disease and received at least two lines of prior endocrine therapy in the metastatic \nsetting. Patients also were eligible if they had received one prior line of endocrine therapy combined with a \nCDK 4/6 inhibitor in the metastatic setting and experienced disease progression within  six months of starting \nfirst-line treatment  or received endocrine therapy as an adjuvant treatment and experienced disease \nrecurrence within 24 months . \n \nThe primary endpoint is progression -free survival (PFS) in the HR positive, HER2 low patient population as \nmeasured by  blinded independent central review (BICR) . Key secondary endpoints include PFS by BICR in \nthe overall trial population (HER2 low and HER2 ultralow),  overall survival  (OS) in patients in the HER2 \nlow patient population and OS in the overall trial population. Other secondary endpoints include objective \nresponse rate , duration of response , time to first subsequent treatment or death, time to second subsequent \ntreatment or death and safety. Analysis of the HER2 ultralow subgroup was not powered to demonstrate \nstatistical significance.  \n \nDESTINY -Breast06 enrolled 866 patients (n=713 for HER2 low and n=153 for HER2 ultralow) at multiple \nsites in Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and South America. For more information about the trial, visit \nClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Breast Cancer and HER2 Expression  \nBreast  cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.1 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022 with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally.1 In Japan, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with approximately 92,000 \ncases of breast cancer diagnosed in 2022.2 While survival rates are high for those diagnosed with early breast \ncancer, only about 30% of patients diagnosed with or who progress to metastatic disease are exp ected to live \nfive years following diagnosis.3 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors, including breast cancer .6 Patients with high levels of HER2 expression (IHC 3+ or IHC2+/ISH+) are \nclassified as HER2  positive and treated with HER2  targeted therapies , representing approximately 15 to 20%\n3 \n of all breast cancers .7 Historically, tumors that were not classified as HER2  positive were classified as HER2  \nnegative , despite the fact that many of these tumors still carry some level of HER2 expression.8 It is \nestimated that approximately 60% to 65%  of HR  positive , HER2 negative  breast cancers are HER2  low and \npotentially an additional  25% may be HER2  ultralow.4,5 \n \nEndocrine therapies are widely given consecutively in the early lines of treatment for HR  positive metastatic \nbreast cancer . However, following  two lines of endoc rine therapy , further efficacy with additional endocrine \ntreatment  is often limited. 9 The current standard of care following endocrine therapy is chemotherapy, which \nis associated with poor response rates and outcomes.9,10,11,12 \n \nPrior to the approval of ENHERTU following chemotherapy in HER2 low metastatic breast cancer based on \nthe DESTINY -Breast04 trial, there were no targeted therapies approved specifically for patients with HER2 \nlow expression .13 There are no targeted therapies specifically approved for patients with HER2 ultralow \nexpression.14  \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nantibody drug conjugate (ADC ).

The Prescription \nDrug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date, the FDA action date for their regulatory decision, i s February 1, 2025 . \nThe Priority Review follows receipt of  Breakthrough Therapy Designation  granted  by the FDA for \nENHERTU  based on data from the DESTINY -Breast06  phase 3 trial  in August 2024 .  \n \nHormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2  negative is the most common breast cancer subtype, accounting for \napproximately 70% of all breast cancers.1 Despite being classified as HER2  negative, many of these tumors \nstill carry some level of HER2 expression.2 It is estimated that up to 85% to 90% of tumors  historically \nclassified as HR positive, HER2  negative, may be HER2 low or HER2 ultralow .3,4 \n \nThe sBLA is based on data from DESTINY -Breast06  presented  as a late -breaking oral session at the 2024 \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology (#ASCO24) Annual Meeting  and recently published in The New\n2 \n England Journal of Medicine . In the overall trial population , ENHERTU  reduced the risk of disease \nprogression or death by 37% by blinded independent central review (BICR) versus chemotherapy (hazard \nratio [HR] 0.63 ; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53 -0.75; p<0.0001). Median progression -free survival (PFS)  \nwas 13.2 months with E NHERTU  compared to 8.1 months with chemotherapy.  \n \nResults were consistent  in patients with HER2  low expression and HER2  ultralow expression. In the primary \nendpoint analysis of  patie nts with HR positive, HER2 low metastatic breast cancer, median PFS was 13.2 \nmonths in the ENHERTU arm compared to 8.1 months in the  chemotherapy  arm (HR 0.62; 95% CI: 0.51 -\n0.74; p<0.0001) , as assessed by BICR. In a prespecified exploratory analysis of patients with HER2 ultralow \nexpression, ENHERTU showed a median PFS of 13.2 months versus 8.3 months, respectively (HR 0.78; \n95% CI : 0.50-1.21).  \n \nThe safety profile of ENHERTU  in DESTINY -Breast06 was consistent with previous breast cancer clinical \ntrials with no new safety concerns identified. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment related treatment  \nemergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring in 5% or more of patients treated with ENHERTU were \nneutropenia ( 20.7%),  leukopenia  (6.9%) and anemia ( 5.8%). Interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis \noccurred in 11.3% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The majority of ILD  or pneumonitis  events were low \ngrade (grade 1 [n=7 ; 1.6% ] or grade 2 [n=36 ; 8.3% ]). There were three  grade 3 ILD events (0.7%) , zero \ngrade 4 events  and three grade 5 events (0.7 %) as determined by an independent adjudication  committee.  \n \n“This Priority Review highlights the potential to expand the existing indication of ENHERTU in HER2  low \nmetastatic breast cancer to include use in an earlier disease setting as well as in a broader patient population \nthat includes HER2 ultralow, ” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “We look \nforward to working closely with the FDA with the goal of bringing ENHERTU to more patients as quickly as \npossible.”   \n \n“While endocrine therapies are widely used in the initial treatment of HR  positive metastatic breast cancer, \nmost patients see limited benefit with additional lines of treatment and subsequent chemotherapy is \nassociated with poor response rates and outcomes ,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice \nPresident, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “The results from  DESTINY -Breast06 show that ENHERTU has \nthe potential to evolve  the current HR  positive treatment landscape and become the first targeted treatment  \nfor patients with HER2  low or HER2  ultralow expression following endocrine therapy. ”  \n \nAbout D ESTINY -Breast06  \nDESTINY -Breast06 is a global, randomized, open -label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) versus investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, paclitaxel or nab \npaclitaxel) in patients with HR positive, HER2 low ( IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 ultralow (defined as\n3 \n IHC 0 with membrane staining [IHC >0 <1+]) advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients in the trial had \nno prior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease and received at least two lines of prior endocrine \ntherapy in the metastatic setting. Patien ts also were eligible if they had received one prior line of endocrine \ntherapy combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the metastatic setting and experienced disease progression \nwithin six months of starting first -line treatment or received endocrine therapy a s an adjuvant treatment and \nexperienced disease recurrence within 24 months.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY -Breast06 is PFS in the HR positive, HER2 low patient population as \nmeasured by  BICR . Key secondary endpoints include PFS by BICR in the overall trial population (HER2 \nlow and HER2 ultralow), overall survival (OS) in patients in the HER2 low patient population and OS in the \noverall trial population. Other secondary endpoints include objective r esponse rate, duration of response, \ntime to first subsequent treatment or death, time to second subsequent treatment or death and safety. Analysis \nof the HER2 ultralow subgroup was not powered to demonstrate statistical significance.  \n \nDESTINY -Breast06 enrolled 866 patients (n=713 for HER2 low and n=153 for HER2 ultralow) at multiple \nsites in Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and South America. For more information about the trial, visit \nClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Breast Cancer and HER2 Expression  \nBreast  cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.5 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022 with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally.5 In the U.S. , more than 300 ,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually.6 While \nsurvival rates are high for those diagnosed with early breast cancer, only about 30% of patients diagnosed \nwith or who progress to metastatic disease are expected to live five years following diagnosis.1 \n \nHR positive, HER2  negative is the most common breast cancer subtype, accounting for approximately 70% \nof all breast cancers.1 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface \nof many types of tumors, including breast cancer.7 Patients with high levels of HER2 expression (IHC 3+ or \nIHC2+/ISH+) are classified as HER2 positive and treated with HER2 targeted therapies, representing \napproximately 15 to 20% percent of all breast cancers.8 Historically, tumors that were not classified as HER2 \npositive were classified as HER2 negative, despite the fact that many of these tumors still carry some level of \nHER2 expression.2 It is estimated that approximately 60% to 65% of HR positive, HER2 negative breast \ncancers are HER2 low and potentially an additional 25% may be HER2 ultralow.3,4 \n \nEndocrine therapies are widely given consecutively in the early lines of treatment for HR positive metastatic \nbreast cancer. However, following two lines of endocrine therapy, further efficacy with additional endocrine\n4 \n treatment is often limited. 9 The current standard of care following endocrine therapy is chemotherapy, which \nis associated with poor response rates and outcomes.9,10,11,12 \n \nPrior to the approval of ENHERTU following chemotherapy in HER2 low metastatic breast cancer based on \nthe DESTINY -Breast04  trial, there were no targeted therapies approved specifically for patients with HER2 \nlow expression.13 There are no targeted therapies specifically approved for patients with HER2 ultralow \nexpression.14  \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 m onoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 65 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or in-situ hybridization (ISH)+) breast cancer who \nhave received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or \nadjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy \nbased on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial. \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 6 5 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior \nsystemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within si x months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial. \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 45 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2  (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results \nfrom the  DESTINY -Lung02  trial. Continued approval in the U.S. for this indication may be contingent upon \nverification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 45 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+)  gastric or gastroesophageal \njunction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric02  and/or DESTINY -Gastric06  trials. Full approval in\n5 \n China for this indication will depend on whether a randomized controlled confirmatory clinical trial can \ndemonstrate clinical benefit in this population . \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic treatment and have no \nsatisfactory alternative treatment options based on efficacy results from the DESTINY -PanTumor02 , \nDESTINY -Lung01  and DESTINY -CRC02  trials. Continued approval for this indication  in the U.S.  may be \ncontingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers. Trials in combination with other \nanticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019  and datopotamab deruxtecan in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of \nENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nAbout  the ADC  Portfolio  of Daiichi  Sankyo   \nThe Daiichi  Sankyo  ADC  portfolio  consists  of seven  ADCs  in clinical  development  crafted  from  two distinct  \nADC  technology  platforms  discovered  in-house  by Daiichi  Sankyo.  \n \nThe ADC  platform  furthest  in clinical  development  is Daiichi  Sankyo’s  DXd  ADC  Technology  where  each \nADC  consists  of a monoclonal  antibody  attached  to a number  of topoisomerase  I inhibitor  payloads  (an \nexatecan  derivative,  DXd)  via tetrapeptide -based  cleavable  linkers.  The DXd  ADC  portfolio  currently  \nconsists  of ENHERTU,  a HER2  directed  ADC,  and datopotamab  deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd),  a TROP2  directed  \nADC,  which  are being  jointly  developed  and commercialized  globally  with AstraZeneca.  Patritumab  \nderuxtecan  (HER3 -DXd),  a HER3  directed  ADC,  ifinatamab  deruxtecan  (I-DXd),  a B7-H3 directed  ADC,  \nand raludotatug  deruxtecan  (R-DXd),  a CDH6  directed  ADC,  are being  jointly  developed  and \ncommercialized  globally  with Merck.  DS-3939,  a TA-MUC1  directed  ADC,  is being  developed  by Daiichi  \nSankyo.  \n \nThe second  Daiichi  Sankyo  ADC  platform  consists  of a monoclonal  antibody  attached  to a modified  \npyrrolobenzodiazepine  (PBD)  payload.  DS-9606,  a CLDN6  directed  PBD  ADC,  is the first of several  \nplanned  ADCs  in clinical  development  utilizing  this platform.\n6 \n Datopotamab  deruxtecan,  ifinatamab  deruxtecan,  patritumab  deruxtecan,  raludotatug  deruxtecan,  DS-3939  \nand DS-9606  are investigational  medicines  that have  not been  approved  for any indication  in any country.  \nSafety  and efficacy  have  not been  established.  \n \nENHERTU U.S. Important Safety Information  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC 3+ or ISH positive) breast cancer who have received a \nprior anti -HER2 -based regimen either:  \n– In the metastatic setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six \nmonths of completing therapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer, as determined by an \nFDA -approved test, who have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed \ndisease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuv ant chemotherapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 \n(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA -approved test, and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH positive) gastric or \ngastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic \ntreatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindications  \nNone.\n7 \n Warnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life -threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imagin g. Cons ider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose one lev el. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroi d treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5  months (range: \n0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonit is occurred in 1.0% of patients treated with \nENHERTU.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8  months (range: \n1.2 to 21). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Co unt [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia  (ANC \n<1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 63% of patients. Seventeen percent \nhad Grade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n22 days (range: 2  to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1% of patients.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty -one percent had \nGrade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was report ed in 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and\n8 \n absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment \nwithin 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from \nbaseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume \ntreatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is \n>20%, interrupt ENHERTU and re peat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU \nhas not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to \ninitiation of treatment.  \n \nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 3.8% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade  3. \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade  2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU.

Advise patients \nof the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant \nwomen, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions \nin a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during tre atment with ENHERTU and for 7 months \nafter the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing : Verify pregnancy status of females \nof reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : ENHERTU can \ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to \nuse effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 1287 patients with HER2 -positive or HER2 -low breast cancer treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 years and 3.8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy \nwithin clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compare d to younger patients. \nThere was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (59%) \nas compared to younger patients (49%). Of the 101 patients with HER2 -mutant unresectable or \nmetastatic NSCLC treated  with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to \nyounger patients. Of the 125 patients with HER2 -positive locally advanced or metasta tic gastric or GEJ \nadenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and \n14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 \nyears of age compared to younger patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2 -positive (IHC 3+) \nunresectable or metastatic solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -PanTumor02, \nDESTINY -Lung01, or DESTINY -CRC02, 39% were 65 years or older and 9% were 75 years or older.\n12 \n No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared \nto younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL /min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA -1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the \nworld.

An improvement in patient -reported outcomes was also seen.1 The PFS \ndata and additional results for key secondary endpoints were published this month in the Journal of Clinical \nOncology . \n \nThe safety profile of datopotamab deruxtecan was consistent with that observed in the previous analysis , \nincluding lower rates of grade 3 or higher treatment -related adverse events compared to chemotherapy, and \nno new safety concerns identified. All grade interstitial lung disease (ILD) rates remained  low with no new \ngrade 3 or higher ILD events observed .  \n \nWith ADCs approved during the course of the trial, including  ENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan), \nsubsequent treatment following  patients’  disease progression or  treatment  discontinuation is likely to have  \naffected survival  results .\n2 \n “Datopotamab deruxtecan has previously shown a statistically significant progression -free survival benefit in \nTROPION -Breast0 1, a result supported by multiple meaningful secondary measures including patient -\nreported outcomes ,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “ We are  proud to have \nbrought forth a new standard of care for patients with metastatic  breast cancer  with ENHERTU and we \nremain committed to making datopotamab deruxtecan another potential  option  for patients who can benefit .”  \n \n“The metastatic HR positive  breast cancer treatment landscape has advanced remarkably in  the last several \nyears  to the benefit of patients ,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology \nR&D, AstraZeneca. “ Based on the TROPION -Breast01 results, there is evidence of the clinical value of \ndatopotamab deruxtecan in this setting. We will continue  discussions with regulatory authorities and  apply \ninsights from these results to our clinical development program for datopotamab deruxtecan in breast \ncancer. ”  \n \nThe data  will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and shared with regulatory authorities currently \nreviewing applications for this indication.   \n \nIn addition to TROPION -Breast01, Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca are evaluating  datopotamab deruxtecan  \nalone and with immunotherapy as treatment for patients with triple negative or HR low, HER2 negative  \nbreast cancer s in the TROPION -Breast02 , TROPION -Breast03 , TROPION -Breast04  and TROPION -\nBreast05  phase 3 trials . \n \nAbout TROPION -Breast 01 \nTROPION -Breast01  is a global, randomized, multicenter, open -label phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and \nsafety of datopotamab deruxtecan (6.0 mg/kg) versus investigator’s choice of single -agent chemotherapy \n(eribulin, capecitabine, vinorelbine or gemcitabine) in adult patients  with unresectable or metastatic HR \npositive, HER2  low or  negative (IHC  0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have progressed on and \nare not suitable for endocrine therapy per investigator assessment and have received at least one additional \nsystemic therapy for unresectable or metastatic disease.  \n \nFollowing disease progression or discontinuation of datopotamab deruxtecan or chemotherapy, p atients had \nthe option to receive subsequent treatment at the discretion of their physician. Crossover between trial arms \nwas not permitted . \n \nThe dual primary endpoints of TROPION -Breast01 are PFS as assessed by blinded independent central \nreview and OS. Key secondary endpoints include objective response rate, duration of response , investigator -\nassessed PFS,  disease control rate , time to first subsequent therapy  and safety .\n3 \n TROPION -Breast01 enrolled more than 700 patients in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South \nAmerica . For more information visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.2 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022 , with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally .2 While survival rates are high for those diagnosed with early breast cancer, less than 35% of \npatients diagnosed with or who progress to metastatic disease are expected to live five years following \ndiagnosis.3  \n \nApproximately  70% of diagnosed cases are considered what has been  historically called HR positive, HER2 \nnegative breast cancer  (measured as HER2 score of IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -).3 Endocrine therapies \nare widely given consecutively in the early lines of treatment for HR positive metastatic breast cancer.4 \nHowever, following two lines of endocrine therapy, further efficacy with additional endocrine treatment is \noften limited .4 The current standard of care following endocrine therapy is chemotherapy, which is \nassociated with poor response rates and outcomes.4,5,6,7 \n \nTROP2 is a protein broadly expressed in HR positive, HER2  negative breast cancer  and is associated with \nincreased tumor progression and poor survival .8,9 \n  \nAbout Datopotamab Deruxtecan (Dato -DXd)  \nDatopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) is an investigational TROP2 directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi \nSankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, datopotamab deruxtecan is one of six DXd ADCs in the \noncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanced programs in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific platform. Datopotamab deruxtecan  is comprised of a humanized anti -TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal \nantibody, developed in collaboration with Sapporo Medical University, attached to a number of \ntopoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway with more than 20 trials evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan across multiple cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer,  \ntriple negative breast cancer and HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. The program includes seven \nphase 3 trials in lung cancer and five phase 3 trials in breast cancer evaluating datopotamab deruxtecan as a \nmonotherapy and in combination with other anticancer treatments in various settings.\n4 \n About the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU  in March 2019  and datopotamab  deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020 , except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the \nmanufacturing and supply of ENHERTU  and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nAbout the ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two distinct \nADC technology platforms discovered in -house by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n  \nThe ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC Technology where each \nADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an \nexatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleava ble linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently \nconsists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd), a TROP2 directed \nADC, which are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca. Patritumab \nderuxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a HER3 directed ADC, ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd), a B7 -H3 directed ADC, \nand raludotatug deruxtecan (R -DXd), a CDH6 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and \ncommercialized globally with Merck. DS -3939, a TA -MUC1 directed ADC, is being developed  by Daiichi \nSankyo.  \n \nThe second Daiichi Sankyo ADC platform consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a modified \npyrrolobenzodiazepine ( PBD ) payload.

Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH positive) gastric or \ngastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic \ntreatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and dur ation of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life -threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. E valuate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose . If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanen tly discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.\n6 \n HER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5  months (range: \n0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonit is occurred in 1.0% of patients treated with \nENHERTU.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8  months (range: \n1.2 to 21). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Co unt [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia  (ANC \n<1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 63% of patients. Seventeen percent \nhad Grade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n22 days (range: 2  to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1% of patients.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty -one percent had \nGrade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment \nwithin 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from \nbaseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume \ntreatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is \n>20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF asse ssment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU \nhas not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to \ninitiation of treatment.  \n \nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 3.8% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade  3.\n7 \n  \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade  2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive poten tial to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and  for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nHER2 -Positive and HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \n1799 patients in Study DS8201 -A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast02, \nDESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -Breast04, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY -Lung02, D ESTINY -CRC02, and \nDESTINY -PanTumor02.

Advise \npatients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in \npregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse \nreactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during tre atment with ENHERTU and \nfor 7 months after the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing : Verify pregnancy status of \nfemales of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 \nmonths after the last dose. Males : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the \nlast dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric \npatients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 1287 patients with HER2 -positive or HER2 -low breast cancer treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 years and 3.8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in \nefficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compare d to \nyounger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients \naged ≥65 years (59%) as compared to younger patients (49%). Of the 101 patients with HER2 -\nmutant unresectable or metastatic NSCLC treated  with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years \nand 8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients \n≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with HER2 -positive locally \nadvanced or metasta tic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in \nDESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in \nefficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of \nthe 192 patients with HER2 -positive (IHC 3+) unresectable or metastatic solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -PanTumor02, DESTINY -Lung01, or DESTINY -CRC02, 39% \nwere 65 years or older and 9% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in  efficacy or safety \nwere observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in \npatients with moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more \nfrequently. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with \nsevere renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA -1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.\n11 \n Please see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi  Sankyo  is an innovative  global  healthcare  company  contributing  to the sustainable  development  of \nsociety  that discovers,  develops  and delivers  new standards  of care to enrich  the quality  of life around  the \nworld.

Results will be \npresented today  as a late -breaking proffered paper presentation  (LBA18 ) at the European Society for Medical \nOncology (#ESMO24) and simultaneously published in Nature Medicine .   \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2  directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by \nDaiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and being jointly developed and commerciali zed by Daiichi Sankyo and \nAstraZeneca ( LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN ).  \n \nIn the primary endpoint analysis of progression- free survival (PFS) assessed by independent central review \nin patients with brain metastases at baseline (n=263), ENHERTU achieved a 12-month PFS rate of 61.6% \n(95% confidence interval [CI]: 54.9-67.6). In an additional endpoint analysis in this patient population, ENHERTU demonstrated  a central nervous system ( CNS ) 12- month  PFS rate of 58.9% (95% CI: 51.9-65.3 ). \nResults were consistent in patients with stable and active brain metastases. Patients with stable brain \nmetastases (n=157) had a 12 -month PFS rate of 62.9% (95% CI: 54.0-70.5 ) and a 12- month CNS PFS rate of \n57.8% (95% CI: 48.2-66.1). Patients with active brain metastases (n= 106) had a 12 -month PFS rate of 59.6% \n(95% CI: 49.0-68.7 ) and a 12-month CNS PFS rate of 60.1% (95% CI: 49.2-69.4).  \n In the primary endpoint analysis of confirmed objective response rate (ORR)  assessed by independent central \nreview  in patients with no b rain metastases at baseline (n= 241), ENHERTU demonstrated  an ORR of 62.7% \n(95% CI: 56.5-68.8) with 23 complete responses (CR) and 128 partial responses (PR).  \n An additional endpoint analysis of CNS ORR in patients with brain metastases at baseline showed ENHERTU demonstrated a CNS ORR of  62.3% (95% CI: 50.1-74.5; n=38/61) in patients with active brain\n2 \n metastases and  79.2% (95% CI: 70.2- 88.3; n=61/77) in patients with stable brain metastases.  A post -hoc \nanalysis in patients with active brain metastases showed the CNS ORR was 82.6% ( 95% CI: 67.1- 98.1; \nn=19/23) in untreated patients and 50.0% ( 95% CI: 34.1- 65.9; n= 19/38) in patients with treated/progressing \nbrain metastases.  \n \n“Up to fifty percent  of patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer experienc e the spread of disease \nto the brain  during the course of their illness , which  significantly impact s quality of life and outcomes ,” said \nNancy Lin, MD, Associate Chief, Division of Breast Oncology, Dana -Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, \nU.S. and Principal Investigator for the trial. “ These data help f urther  characterize the clinical benefit and \nsafety profile of ENHERTU in these patients, which  will help guide treatment decisions .”  \n \nThe safety profile of ENHERTU in DESTINY -Breast 12 was consistent with previous breast cancer clinical \ntrials with no new safety concerns identified . The safety profile of DESTINY -Brea st12 was generally \nconsistent between the brain metastases and non -brain metastases cohorts. The most common grade 3 or \nhigher adverse events occurring in 5% or more  of patients  in either  cohort  included neutropenia ( 16% in \nbrain metastases and 18% in non- brain metastases), fatigue (9% in brain metastases  and 10% in non- brain \nmetastases ), anemia ( 7% in brain metastases and 5% in non- brain metastases)  and nausea ( 5% in brain \nmetastases and 5% in non- brain metastases) . Interstitial lung disease (ILD)  or pneumonitis occurred in 16.0% \nof patients in the brain metastases cohort  and 12.9% of patients in the non- brain metastases cohort  as \ndetermined by the investigator . In the brain metastases cohort , there  were 26 grade 1  events, eight grade 2 \nevents , one grade 3 event , one  grade 4 event and six  grade 5 events as determined by the investigator . Five \nILD or pneumonitis events in the brain metastases cohort were reported  by the investigator  as co -occurring \nwith opportunistic infection ( one grade 4 and four grade 5 ). In the non- brain metastases cohort, there were 22 \ngrade 1 ILD events, six grade 2 events, zero grade 3 and 4 events, and three grade 5 events as determined by the investigator . \n \n“Treating brain metastases in patients with breast cancer is challenging as there are few effective treatment \noptions ,” said Mark Rutstein , MD, Global Head, Oncology Clinical Development , Daiichi Sankyo. “ Building \non previous studies, t hese results show ENHERTU can provide strong overall and intracranial  clinical \nactivity and support  its potential  role in treating  patients with active or stable brain metastases.”  \n “The results from DESTINY -Breast12 show substantial clinical activity for patients whose disease has \nspread to the brain,” said Sunil Verma , MD, Global Head, Oncology Franchise , AstraZeneca. “ These data as \nwell as the results in patients without brain metastases  further build confidence in the clinical pro file of \nENHERTU  for the second- line treatment of HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer .”\n3 \n Patients in the DESTINY -Breast12 trial received no more than two prior lines of therapy in the metastatic \nsetting. Median duration of follow -up was 15.4 months  (range 0.1-30.0) in the brain metastases cohort  and \n16.1 months (range 0.8-28.4) in the non- brain metastases cohort . A total of 213 patients  (118 in the brain \nmetastases cohort  and 95 in the non- brain metastases cohort ) remained on treatment  as of the data cut -off of \nFebruary 8, 2024. \n \nSummary of DESTINY -Breast12 Primary Analysis Results  \nEfficacy Measure  Baseline Brain Metastases  \n(Cohort 2)  No Baseline \nBrain Metastases \n(Cohort 1)  \nOverall \nPopulation  \n(n=263)  Stable Brain \nMetastases  \n(n=157)i Active Brain \nMetastases  \n(n=106)ii Overall \nPopulation  \n(n=241)iii \n12-month PFS Rate (%)iv  \n(95% CI)  61.6% \n(54.9-67.6) 62.9% \n(54.0-70.5) 59.6% \n(49.0-68.7) --  \n12-month CNS PFS Rate (%)v  \n(95% CI) 58.9%  \n(51.9-65.3) 57.8%  \n(48.2-66.1) 60.1% \n(49.2-69.4) -- \n12 month OS Rate (%) \n(95% CI)  90.3% \n(85.9-93.4) -- -- 90.6% \n(86.0-93.8) \nConfirmed ORR (%)vi, vii  \n(95% CI) 51.7%  \n(45.7-57.8) 49.7% \n(41.9-57.5) 54.7% \n(45.2-64.2) 62.7% \n(56.5-68.8) \nCR % (n)  4.2% (11) -- -- 9.5% (23) \nPR % (n)  47.5% (125)  -- -- 53.1% (128)viii \nConfirmed CNS ORR (%)  (n) \n(95% CI)ix 71.7%  (138)  \n(64.2 -79.3)  79.2%  (77) \n(70.2 -88.3)  62.3%  (61) \n(50.1 -74.5)  -- \nCI, confidence interval; CNS, central nervous system;  CR, complete response; ORR, objective response rate; OS, overall survival; PFS, progression -\nfree survival; PR, partial response  \ni Stable brain metastases (previously treated)  \nii Active brain metastases (untreated or previously treated / progressing [not requiring immediate local therapy])  \niii Includes 26 patients with no measurable disease at baseline \niv Primary endpoint for baseline brain metastases was median PFS  with 42.2% data maturity at time of data cut -off (February  8, 2024) ; post -hoc \nanalysis showed median PFS of 17.3 months (95% CI : 13.7-22.1)  \nv Patients who had systemic progression, but no CNS progression, were censored at the time of the progression assessment; the a nalysis did not \naccount for systemic progression as a competing event  \nvi Primary endpoint for no baseline brain metastases cohort (cohort 1) \nvii ORR is ( CR + PR) \nviii One patient with no measurable disease at baseline was assigned PR by ICR  \nix Analysis of CNS ORR was in patients with measurable CNS disease at baseline  \n About DESTINY- Breast12  \nDESTINY -Breast12 is an open -label, multicenter, phase 3b/4 clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy \nand safety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) in patients with previously treated advanced/metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer. The study includes patients with or without baseline brain metastases who have experienced \ndisease progression following prior anti -HER2 -based regimens and have received no more than two lines of \ntherapy in the metastatic setting . Patients were enrolled into one of two cohorts according to the presence or \nabsence of brain metastases at baseline .\n4 \n The primary endpoint s of DESTINY -Breast12 were P FS (brain metastases cohort ; cohort 2 ) or ORR  (non-\nbrain metastases cohort; cohort 1) as assessed by independent central review. Additional endpoints included \nCNS PFS, CNS ORR , ORR  in the brain metastases cohort and safety.  \n DESTINY -Breast12 enrolled 50 4 patients across multiple sites in Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania. \nFor more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.  About  Breast Cancer, HER2 Expression and Brain Metastases  \nBreast  cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.\n1 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022 with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally.1 While survival rates are high for those diagnosed with early breast cancer, only about 30% \nof patients diagnosed with or who progress to metastatic disease are expected to live five years following \ndiagnosis.2 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers.3 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a \nresult of HER2 gene amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in \nbreast cancer.4 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2  positive.5 \n \nBrain metastases occur when cancer cells spread from their original location to the brain. An estimated 10 % \nto 15% of patients  diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer will develop brain metastases .6 The risk is higher \nfor those with HER2  positive or triple  negative metastatic breast cancer, with brain metastases  occurring in \n30% to 50% of these patients .7  \n The median overall survival for patients with breast cancer who have developed brain metastases is eight months; however, this varies based on subtype and the availability of effective treatments.\n8 Current \nguidelines do not recommend screening patients with breast cancer for brain metastases. As a result, when brain metastases are eventually diagnosed, patients may already present with advanced disease.\n7  \n About ENHERTU ENHERTU  (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 m onoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide- based cleavable linkers.\n5 \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 65 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive ( immunohistochemistry [ IHC] 3+ or in -situ hybridization \n(ISH)+) breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or \nin the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting therapy base d on the results from the DESTINY- Breast03  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 65 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior \nsystemic therapy in the metastatic setting or d eveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 35 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2  (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results \nfrom the  DESTINY -Lung02 trial. Continued approval in the U.S. for this indication may be contingent upon \nverification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 45 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) gastric or gastroesophageal \njunction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab- based regimen based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric02  and/or DESTINY -Gastric06  trials. Full approval in \nChina for this indication will depend on whether a randomized controlled confirmatory clinical trial can \ndemonstrate clinical benefit in this population.  \n ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options based on efficacy results from the DESTINY -PanTumor02, \nDESTINY -Lung01 and DESTINY- CRC02  trials. Continued approval for this indication in the U.S. may be \ncontingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers. Trials in combination with other \nanticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.\n6 \n About the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nAbout the ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  The Daiichi Sankyo ADC portfolio consists of seven ADCs in clinical development crafted from two distinct ADC technology platforms discovered in-house by Daiichi Sankyo.  The ADC platform furthest in clinical development is Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC Technology where each ADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide- based cleavable linkers. The DXd ADC portfolio currently \nconsists of ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), a TROP2 directed \nADC, which are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca. Patritumab \nderuxtecan (HER3- DXd) , a HER3 directed ADC, ifinatamab deruxtecan (I- DXd), a B7 -H3 directed ADC, \nand raludotatug deruxtecan (R-DXd), a CDH6 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with Merck. DS-3939, a TA-MUC1 directed ADC, is being developed by Daiichi Sankyo.  \nThe second Daiichi Sankyo ADC platform consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a modified \npyrrolobenzodiazepine ( PBD) payload. DS-9606, a CLDN6 directed PBD ADC, is the first of several \nplanned ADCs in clinical development utilizing this platform.  \n Datopotamab deruxtecan, ifinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan, raludotatug deruxtecan, DS-3939 and DS-9606 are investigational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.  \n \nENHERTU U.S. Important Safety Information  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC 3+ or ISH positive) breast cancer who have received a \nprior anti -HER2 -based regimen either:  \n– In the metastatic setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six \nmonths of completing therapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH- ) breast cancer, as determined by an \nFDA-approved test, who have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed\n7 \n disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 \n(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test, and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH positive) gastric or \ngastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab- based regimen  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic \ntreatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and dur ation of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY  \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \nContraindications  \nNone. \n \nWarnings and Precautions \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Cons ider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose one lev el. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroi d treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5  months (range: \n0.9 to  31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonit is occurred in 1.0% of patients treated with \nENHERTU.\n8 \n HER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8  months (range: \n1.2 to  21). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC \n<1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 63% of patients. Seventeen percent \nhad Grade 3 or  4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n22 days (range: 2 to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1% of patients. \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty- one percent had \nGrade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Media n time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients. \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment \nwithin 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40- 45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from \nbaseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF asse ssment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU \nhas not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to \ninitiation of treatment.  \n \nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 3.8% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3. \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.\n9 \n Embryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive poten tial to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and  for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nHER2 -Positive and HER2- Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \n1799 patients in Study DS8201-A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY-Breast01, DESTINY -Breast02, \nDESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -Breast04, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY-Lung02, DESTINY-CRC02, and \nDESTINY -PanTumor02. Among these patients, 65% were exposed for >6 months and 38% were exposed \nfor >1 year. In this pooled safety population, the most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including \nlaboratory abnormalities, were nausea (73%), decreased white blood cell count (70%), decreased hemoglobin \n(66%), decreased neutrophil count (63%), decreased lymphocyte count (58%), fatigue (56%), decreased \nplatelet  count (48%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (47%), increased alanine aminotransferase (43%), \nvomiting (40%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (38%), alopecia (34%), constipation (33%), decreased \nappetite (32%), decreased blood potassium (31%), diarrhea (29%), musculoskeletal pain (24%), and \nabdominal pain (20%).  \n \nHER2 -Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nDESTINY-Breast03 \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 257 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast \ncancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously once every three weeks in \nDESTINY -Breast03.

Advise \npatients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse \nreactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during tre atment with ENHERTU and \nfor 7 months after the last dose. \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of \nfemales of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 \nmonths after the last dose. Males : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the \nlast dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility. \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric \npatients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 1287 patients with HER2-positive or HER2- low breast cancer treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 years and 3.8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compare d to \nyounger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (59%) as compared to younger patients (49%). Of the 101 patients with HER2-\nmutant unresectable or metastatic NSCLC treated  with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years \nand 8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients \n≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with HER2- positive locally \nadvanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in \nefficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2- positive (IHC 3+) unresectable or metastatic solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -PanTumor02, DESTINY-Lung01, or DESTINY-CRC02, 39% \nwere 65 years or older and 9% were 75 years or older. No overall differences in efficacy or safety \nwere observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in \npatients with moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with \nsevere renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of society that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the\n13 \n world.

This application is based on data from the DESTINY -Breast06  phase 3 trial  presented  as a late- breaking oral session at the  2024 American Society of \nClinical Oncology (#ASCO24) Annual Meeting.  “This submission  builds on our existing indication  for E NHERTU in patients with HER2 low metastatic \nbreast cancer  and an expanded approval would enable the potential for use  in an earlier disease setting  as \nwell as in a broader patient population that now includes HER2 ultralow ,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global \nHead, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “ We look forward to working closely with the EM A to potentially br ing this \nmedicine  to more patients  in the EU .” \n Additional regulatory submissions for ENHERTU in this indication are underway globally.\n2 \n About D ESTINY- Breast06  \nDESTINY -Breast06 is a global, randomized, open- label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) versus investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, paclitaxel or nab \npaclitaxel) in patients with HR positive, HER2 low (defined as IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 ultralow \n(defined as IHC 0 with membrane staining) advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients in the trial had no \nprior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease and received at least two lines of  prior e ndocrine \ntherapy in the metastatic setting. Patients also were eligible if they had received one prior line of endocrine \ntherapy combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the metastatic setting and experienced disease progression \nwithin six months of starting first- line treatment  or received endocrine therapy as an adjuvant treatment and \nexperienced disease recurrence within 24 months . \n \nThe primary endpoint is progression- free survival ( PFS) in the HR positive, HER2 low patient population as \nmeasured by blinded independent central review (BICR). Key secondary endpoints include PFS by BICR  in \nthe overall trial population (HER2 low and HER2 ultralow), overall survival ( OS) in patients in the HER2 \nlow patient population and OS in the overall trial population. Other secondary endpoints include objective response rate, duration of response , time to first subsequent treatment or death, time to second subsequent \ntreatment or death and safety. Analysis of the HER2 ultralow subgroup was not powered to demonstrate statistical significance.  \n DESTINY -Breast06 enrolled 866 patients (n=713 for HER2 low and n=153 for HER2 ultralow) at multiple \nsites in Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and South America. For more information about the trial, visit \nClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Breast Cancer and HER2 Expression  \nBreast  cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.\n1 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022 with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally.1 In Europe, approximately 557,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually.2 While \nsurvival rates are high for those diagnosed with early breast cancer, only about 30% of patients diagnosed \nwith or who progress to metastatic disease are expected to live five years following  diagnosis.3 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors, including breast cancer.4 Patients with high levels of HER2 expression (IHC 3+ or IHC2+/ISH+) are \nclassified as HER2 positive and treated with HER2 targeted therapies, representing approximately 15 to 20% \npercent of all breast cancers.5 Historically, tumors that were not classified as HER2 positive were classified \nas HER2 negative, despite t he fact that many of these tumors still carry some level of HER2 expression.6 It is \nestimated that approximately 60% to 65% of HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancers are HER2 low and \npotentially an additional 25% may be HER2 ultralow.7,8\n3 \n  \nEndocrine therapies are widely given consecutively in the early lines of treatment for HR  positive metastatic \nbreast cancer .9 However, following two lines of endoc rine therapy, further efficacy with additional endocrine \ntreatment  is often limited.9 The current standard of care following endocrine therapy is chemotherapy, which \nis associated with poor response rates and outcomes.9,10,11,12 \n Prior to the approval of ENHERTU following chemotherapy in HER2 low metastatic breast cancer based on \nthe DESTINY -Breast04  trial, there were no targeted therapies approved specifically for patients with HER2 \nlow expression.\n13 There are no targeted therapies specifically approved for patients with HER2 ultralow \nexpression.14  \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 m onoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 65 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or in-situ hybridization (ISH)+) breast cancer who \nhave received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or \nadjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy \nbased on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 65 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior \nsystemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within si x months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 35 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2  (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results \nfrom the  DESTINY -Lung02 trial. Continued approval in the U.S. for this indication may be contingent upon \nverification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 45 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+)\n gastric or gastroesophageal\n4 \n junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab- based regimen based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric02  and/or DESTINY -Gastric06  trials. Full approval in \nChina for this indication will depend on whether a  randomized controlled confirmatory clinical trial can \ndemonstrate clinical benefit in this population.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic treatment and have no \nsatisfactory alternative treatment options based on efficacy results from the DESTINY -PanTumor02, \nDESTINY -Lung01 and DESTINY- CRC02  trials. Continued approval for this indication in the U.S. may be \ncontingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers. Trials in combination with other \nanticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are under way.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n About  the DXd  ADC Portfolio of  Daiichi  Sankyo   \nThe DXd  ADC  portfolio of  Daiichi  Sankyo currently  consists  of six ADCs  in clinical  development  across  \nmultiple  types  of cancer.  ENHERTU,  a HER2  directed  ADC,  and datopotamab deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd),  a \nTROP2  directed  ADC,  are being jointly  developed and commercialized  globally with  AstraZeneca.  \nPatritumab  deruxtecan  (HER3 -DXd),  a HER3  directed  ADC,  ifinatamab  deruxtecan  (I-DXd),  a B7-H3 \ndirected  ADC,  and raludotatug deruxtecan  (R-DXd),  a CDH6  directed  ADC,  are being jointly  developed and \ncommercialized  globally with  Merck  & Co.,  Inc., Rahway,  N.J. USA.  DS-3939, a  TA-MUC1  directed  ADC,  \nis being developed by Daiichi  Sankyo.  \n Designed  using Daiichi  Sankyo’s  proprietary  DXd  ADC  Technology to target  and deliver  a cytotoxic  \npayload inside  cancer  cells  that express a  specific  cell surface  antigen, each ADC  consists of a monoclonal  \nantibody attached  to a number  of topoisomerase I  inhibitor  payloads  (an exatecan  derivative,  DXd)  via \ntetrapeptide- based  cleavable  linkers.\n5 \n Datopotamab  deruxtecan,  ifinatamab  deruxtecan,  patritumab  deruxtecan, raludotatug deruxtecan  and  \nDS-3939 are investigational medicines that have  not been  approved  for any indication  in any country.

The medicine needs to have shown encouraging preliminary clinical results \nthat demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint over available medicines.   \n \nThe FDA granted this BTD based on data from the DESTINY -Breast06  phase 3 trial presented  as a  \nlate-breaking oral session  at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology (#ASCO24) Annual Meeting.  \n \n“If approved, ENHERTU could once again change the treatment paradigm for certain  patients with breast \ncancer , pushing past old boundaries and broadening the number of people who may be  eligible for  a HER2  \ndirected therapy,”  said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo . “The designation also \nshowcases Daiichi Sankyo’s commitment to pioneering cutting -edge science to deliver medicines like \nENHERTU that create  new standards of care for patients with cancer .”\n2 \n  \nENHERTU has received eight BTDs, including  four in metastatic breast cancer . In addition to the new BTD, \nthe three previous  BTDs for breast cancer  were for  later-line HER2 low metastatic breast cancer, second -line \nHER2 positive metastatic breast cancer and later -line HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer . ENHERTU  \nalso received  four additional BTDs , including  for HER2 positive (IHC 3+)  metastatic solid tumors , HER2 \npositive metastatic colorectal cancer , HER2  (ERBB2 ) mutant metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) \nand HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer.  The new  BTD  for ENHERTU  also represent s the eleventh BTD \nacross Daiichi Sankyo’s oncology pipeline.  \n \nAbout D ESTINY -Breast06  \nDESTINY -Breast06 is a global, randomized, open -label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) versus investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, paclitaxel or nab \npaclitaxel) in patients with HR positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 ultralow (defined as \nIHC 0 with membrane staining [IHC >0 <1+]) advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients in the trial had \nno prior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease and received at least two lines of prior endocrine \ntherapy in the metastatic setting. Patients also were eligible if they had received one prior line of endocrine \ntherapy co mbined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the metastatic setting and experienced disease progression \nwithin six months of starting first -line treatment or received endocrine therapy as an adjuvant treatment and \nexperienced disease recurrence within 24 months.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY -Breast06 is progression -free survival (PFS) in the HR positive, HER2 \nlow patient population as measured by blinded independent central review (BICR). Key secondary endpoints \ninclude PFS by BICR in the overall trial populatio n (HER2 low and HER2 ultralow), overall survival (OS) in \npatients in the HER2 low patient population and OS in the overall trial population. Other secondary \nendpoints include objective response rate, duration of response, time to first subsequent treatment  or death, \ntime to second subsequent treatment or death and safety. Analysis of the HER2 ultralow subgroup was not \npowered to demonstrate statistical significance.  \n \nDESTINY -Breast06 enrolled 866 patients (n=713 for HER2 low and n=153 for HER2 ultralow) at multiple \nsites in Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and South America. For more information about the trial, visit \nClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Breast Cancer and HER2 Expression  \nBreast  cancer is the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.1 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022 with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally.1 In the U.S. , more than  300,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually.2 While\n3 \n survival rates are high for those diagnosed with early breast cancer, only about 30% of patients diagnosed \nwith or who progress to metastatic disease are expected to live five years following diagnosis.3 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors, including breast cancer.4 Patients with high levels of HER2 expression (IHC 3+ or IHC2+/ISH+) are \nclassified as HER2 positive and treated with HER2 targeted therapies, representing approximately 15 to 20% \npercent of all breast cancers.5 Historically, tumors that were not classified as HER2 positive were classified \nas HER2 negative, despite the fact that many of these tumors still carry some level of HER2 expression.6 It is \nestimated that approximately 60% to 65% of HR positive , HER2 negative  breast cancers are HER2 low and \npotentially an additional 25% may be HER2 ultralow.7,8 \n \nEndocrine therapies are widely given consecutively in the early lines of treatment for HR positive metastatic \nbreast cancer. However, following two lines of endocrine therapy, further efficacy with additional endocrine \ntreatment is often limited. 9 The current standard of care following endocrine therapy is chemotherapy, which \nis associated with poor response rates and outcomes.9,10,11,12 \n \nPrior to the approval of ENHERTU following chemotherapy in HER2 low metastatic breast cancer based on \nthe DESTINY -Breast04  trial, there were no targeted therapies approved specifically for patients with HER2 \nlow expression.13 There are no targeted therapies specifically approved for patients with HER2 ultralow \nexpression.14  \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 m onoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 65 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or in-situ hybridization (ISH)+) breast cancer who \nhave received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or \nadjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy \nbased on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial. \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 6 5 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior\n4 \n systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial. \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 35 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2  (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results \nfrom the  DESTINY -Lung02  trial. Continued approval in the U.S. for this indication may be contingent upon \nverification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 45 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+)  gastric or gastroesophageal \njunction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric02  and/or DESTINY -Gastric06  trials. Full approval in \nChina for this indication will depend on whether a randomized controlled confirmatory clinical trial can \ndemonstrate clinical benefit in this population . \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic treatment and have no \nsatisfactory alternative treatment options based on efficacy results from the DESTINY -PanTumor02 , \nDESTINY -Lung01  and DESTINY -CRC02  trials. Continued approval for this indication  in the U.S.  may be \ncontingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global clinical development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers. Trials in combination with other \nanticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are under way.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019  and datopotamab deruxtecan in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of \nENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nAbout  the DXd  ADC  Portfolio  of Daiichi  Sankyo   \nThe DXd  ADC  portfolio  of Daiichi  Sankyo  currently  consists  of six ADCs  in clinical  development  across  \nmultiple  types  of cancer.  ENHERTU,  a HER2  directed  ADC,  and datopotamab  deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd),  a \nTROP2  directed  ADC,  are being  jointly  developed  and commercialized  globally  with AstraZeneca.\n5 \n Patritumab  deruxtecan  (HER3 -DXd),  a HER3  directed  ADC,  ifinatamab  deruxtecan  (I-DXd),  a B7-H3 \ndirected  ADC,  and raludotatug  deruxtecan  (R-DXd),  a CDH6  directed  ADC,  are being  jointly  developed  and \ncommercialized  globally  with Merck  & Co., Inc., Rahway,  N.J. USA.  DS-3939,  a TA-MUC1  directed  ADC,  \nis being  developed  by Daiichi  Sankyo.   \n \nDesigned  using  Daiichi  Sankyo’s  proprietary  DXd  ADC  Technology  to target  and deliver  a cytotoxic  \npayload  inside  cancer  cells that express  a specific  cell surface  antigen,  each ADC  consists  of a monoclonal  \nantibody  attached  to a number  of topoisomerase  I inhibitor  payloads  (an exatecan  derivative,  DXd)  via \ntetrapeptide -based  cleavable  linkers.  \n \nDatopotamab  deruxtecan,  ifinatamab  deruxtecan,  patritumab  deruxtecan,  raludotatug  deruxtecan  and  \nDS-3939  are investigational  medicines  that have  not been  approved  for any indication  in any country.  Safety  \nand efficacy  have  not been  established.  \n \nENHERTU U.S. Important Safety Information  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC 3+ or ISH positive) breast cancer who have received a \nprior anti -HER2 -based regimen either:  \n– In the metastatic setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six \nmonths of completing therapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer, as determined by an \nFDA -approved test, who have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed \ndisease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuv ant chemotherapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 \n(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA -approved test, and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval b ased on objective response rate and duration of \nresponse.

Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\n6 \n WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life -threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. E valuate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose . If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanen tly discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5  months (range: \n0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonit is occurred in 1.0% of patients treated with \nENHERTU.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8  months (range: \n1.2 to 21). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Co unt [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia  (ANC \n<1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 63% of patients. Seventeen percent \nhad Grade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil coun t was \n22 days (range: 2  to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1% of patients.\n7 \n  \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty -one percent had \nGrade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Media n time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment \nwithin 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from \nbaseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume \ntreatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is \n>20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF asse ssment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU \nhas not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to \ninitiation of treatment.  \n \nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 3.8% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade  3. \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade  2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive poten tial to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and  for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nHER2 -Positive and HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \n1799 patients in Study DS8201 -A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast02, \nDESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -Breast04, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY -Lung02, D ESTINY -CRC02, and \nDESTINY -PanTumor02.

The median duration of treatment was 14 months (range: 0.7 to 30).  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 19% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were vomiting, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, pyrexia, and \nurinary tract infection. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients including COVID -19 \nand sudden death (one patient each).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 14% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis accounted for 8%. \nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose  interruption were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, pneumonia, nausea, fatigue, and ILD/pneumonitis. Dose reductions occurred in 21% of \npatients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction \nwere nausea,  neutropenia, and fatigue.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (76%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (70%), increased aspartate \naminotransferase (67%), decreased hemoglobin (64%), decreased lym phocyte count (55%), increased alanine \naminotransferase (53%), decreased platelet count (52%), fatigue (49%), vomiting (49%), increased blood \nalkaline phosphatase (49%), alopecia (37%), decreased blood potassium (35%), constipation (34%), \nmusculoskeletal p ain (31%), diarrhea (29%), decreased appetite (29%), headache (22%), respiratory \ninfection (22%), abdominal pain (21%), increased blood bilirubin (20%), and stomatitis (20%).  \n \nHER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nDESTINY -Breast04  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 371 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ \nor IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks in \nDESTINY -Breast04. The median duration of treatment was 8  months (range: 0.2  to 33) for patients who \nreceived ENHERTU.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 28% of patients receiving ENHERTU.

Advise patients \nof the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant \nwomen, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions \nin a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months \nafter the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing : Verify pregnancy status of females \nof reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : ENHERTU can \ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to \nuse effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 1287 patients with HER2 -positive or HER2 -low breast cancer treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 years and 3.8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy\n11 \n within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. \nThere was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (59%) \nas compared to younger patients (49%). Of the 101 pa tients with HER2 -mutant unresectable or \nmetastatic NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to \nyounger patients. Of  the 125 patients with HER2 -positive locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ \nadenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and \n14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed bet ween patients ≥65 \nyears of age compared to younger patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2 -positive (IHC 3+) \nunresectable or metastatic solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -PanTumor02, \nDESTINY -Lung01, or DESTINY -CRC02, 39% were 65 years o r older and 9% were 75 years or older. \nNo overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared \nto younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA -1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the \nworld.

This indication \nwas granted conditional approval based on results from the DESTINY -Gastric06  phase 2 trial. Full approval \nfor this indication will depend on whether a randomized controlled confirmatory clinical trial can \ndemonstrate clinical benefit in this population.  \n ENHERTU is  a specifically engineered HER2  directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by \nDaiichi Sankyo and being jointly developed and commerciali zed by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca.  \n \nApproximately one in five gastric cancers globally are HER2 positive.\n1,2 More than  one third of the global  \ncases of gastric cancer occur in China, with about 65%  of patients presenting with advanced disease at the \ntime of diagnosis.3,4,5 Approximately 359,000 new cases of gastric cancer and 260,000 deaths were  reported \nin China in 2022.3  \n \nThe conditional approval by China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) is based on results \nfrom the DESTINY -Gastric06  phase 2 trial , where ENHERTU demonstrated clinically meaningful responses \nin patients in China with HER2 positive locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma previously treated with two or more prior regimens including a fluoropyrimidine agent and a platinum agent. \n In DESTINY -Gastric06, treatment with ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) resulted in a confirmed objective response \nrate (ORR) of 28.8% (95% confidence interval [ CI]: 18.8-40.6) as assessed by independent central review, \nwith one complete response and 20 partial responses observed. Median progression- free survival (PFS) with \nENHERTU was 5.7 months (95% CI: 4.0-6.8).\n2 \n The approval also was support ed by results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  phase 2  trial, which included \npatients from Japan and South Korea . In the trial, patients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer \ntreated with ENHERTU  showed a statistically significant improvement in confirmed ORR ( 40.5% with \nENHERTU versus 11.3%  with chemotherapy; p<0.0001) and median overall survival (OS) (12.5 months \nwith ENHERTU versus 8.4 months  with chemotherapy ; hazard ratio [HR] 0.59; 95% confidence interval \n[CI] 0.39- 0.88; p=0.0097)  versus chemotherapy . \n \n“HER2 positive metastatic  gastric cancer can be particular ly aggressive and difficult- to-treat. Patients often \nface poor outcomes following disease progression on  first-line treatment  and subsequent chemotherapy,” said \nLin Shen , MD, Director of the Department of Gastrointestinal Oncology, Peking University Cancer Hospital, \nChina . “With the approval of ENHERTU, patients in China with HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer \nwill now have an important anti-HER2  treatment option  that has demonstrated  clinically meaningful efficacy \nfollowing progression on previous therapies. ”  \n \n“This milestone marks the third approval in China for ENHERTU in less than two years, following approvals \nfor HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer and HER2 low metastatic breast cancer,” said Kiminori Nagao, \nHead of the Asia, South & Central America Business Unit, Daiichi Sankyo. “ Our DESTINY clinical trial \nprogram continues to reinforce ENHERTU as a practice- changing treatment option for p atients with HER2 \nexpressing cancers and this latest  approval in China further illustrates  the global impact of this innovative \nantibody drug conjugate.”  \n \n“China  accounts for more than a third of patients with  gastric cancer globally and most patients are \ndiagnosed with advanced disease ,” said Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business \nUnit, AstraZeneca. “ This approval of ENHERTU brings a much- needed, new targeted treatment option to  \npatients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer in China and underscores our commitment to  bringing  \nthis innova tive medicine  to more patients across the globe living with HER2 expressing  cancers.”  \n \nThe safety profile of ENHERTU in DESTINY -Gastric06 was consistent with previous clinical trials of \nENHERTU in gastric cancer with  no new safety concerns identified. Grade 3 or grade 4 treatment -related \nadverse events (AEs) from a pooled safety analysis of patients treated with ENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg)  across \nmultiple tumor types in clinical studies  included neutropenia (27.9%), anemia (23.1%), leukopenia (12.9%), \nthrombocytopenia (9.0%), fatigue (8.2%), decreased appetite (8.1%), lymphopenia (7.4%), nausea (5.8%), \ntransaminases increased (4.7%), hypokalemia (4.2%), pneumonia (2.9%), febrile neutropenia (2.9%) , \nvomiting (2.4%), diarrhea (2.1%), decreased weight (2.1%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (1.8%), \ninterstitial lung disease (ILD ) (1.6%), dyspnea (1.3%), and ejection fraction decreased (1.1%) . Grade 5 \nadverse reactions occurred in 2.6% of patients, including ILD  (1.9% ). Discontinuation of treatment due to an\n3 \n AE occurred in 17.0% of patients.  The most frequent adverse event associated with permanent \ndiscontinuation was ILD ( 12.4%) .  \n \nAbout DESTINY- Gastric0 6 \nDESTINY -Gastric0 6 is an open- label, single -arm phase 2 trial in China evaluating the safety and efficacy of \nENHERTU (6.4  mg/kg) in patients with HER2 positive  locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ \nadenocarcinoma previously treated with two or more prior regimens including a fluoropyrimidine agent and \na platinum agent.  \n The primary endpoint of DESTINY -Gastric06 is confirmed ORR  by independent central review . Secondary \nendpoints include investigator assessed ORR, PFS, duration of response  (DoR) , disease control rate, OS and \nsafety.  \n DESTINY -Gastric06  enroll ed 95 patients at multiple sites in China.  For more information about the trial, \nvisit clinicaltrials.gov . \n About DESTINY- Gastric01  \nDESTINY -Gastric01 is an  open label, randomized, controlled phase 2 trial evaluating  the efficacy and safety \nof ENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) versus investigator’s choice of chemotherapy in a primary cohort of patients from \nJapan and South Korea with HER2 positive, locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who have progressed on at least two or more prior regimens including trastuzumab plus a fluoropyrimidine - \nand platinum -based chemotherapy combination. Patients were randomized  2:1 to receive ENHERTU  or \nphysician’s choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel or irinotecan monotherapy).  \n \nThe primary endpoint is ORR assessed by independent central review. Key secondary endpoints include OS , \nPFS and DoR.  \n DESTINY -Gastric0 1 enrolled 188 patients at multiple sites in Japan and South Korea . For more information \nabout the trial, visit clinicaltrials.gov . \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Gastric Cancer  \nGastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the fifth  leading cause of cancer -\nrelated death , with a five -year global survival rate of 5% to 10% for advanced or metastatic disease.\n4,6 \nApproximately one million patients were diagnosed with  gastric cancer  in 2022, with  more than 660,000  \ndeaths reported globally.4\n4 \n Incidence rates for gastric cancer are markedly higher in eastern Asia, particularly in China where more than  \none third  of all global  cases occur .3,4 Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer in China with about \n359,000 new cases diagnosed in 2022.3 Additionally, it is the third leading cause of cancer -related death in \nChina, with approximately 260,000 deaths reported in 2022.3 Approximately 65 % of patients in China \npresent with advanced disease at the time of diagnosis.5 \n \nApproximately one in five gastric cancers globally are HER2 positive.1,2 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor \ngrowth promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors , including gastric cancer.2 \nRecommended first -line treatment in  China  for HER2 positive advanced or metastatic gastric cancer is \ncombination chemotherapy and trastuzumab, an anti -HER2 medicine , with or without pembrolizumab .7 For \npatients with metastatic gastric cancer that progresses  following initial treatment with a trastuzumab- based \nregimen , subs equent anti -HER2 treatment options are limited .7 \n About ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 m onoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 65 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or in -situ hybridization (ISH)+) breast cancer who \nhave received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoa djuvant or \nadjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 65 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ (ISH) -) breast cancer who have received a \nprior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months \nof completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 35 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2) mutations, as detected by a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results from th e DESTINY -Lung02 trial. Continued approval in the U.S. for this indication may be \ncontingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\n5 \n ENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 45 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+)  gastric or gastroesophageal \njunction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab- based regimen based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Gastric01 , DESTINY -Gastric02  and/or DESTINY -Gastric06  trials.  Full approval in \nChina for this indication will depend on whether a  randomized controlled confirmatory clinical trial  can \ndemonstrate clinical benefit in this population.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options based on efficacy results from the DESTINY -PanTumor02, \nDESTINY -Lung01 \nand DESTINY -CRC02  trials. Continued approval for this indication in the U.S. may be \ncontingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global  clinical  development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers. Trials in combination with other \nanticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights  for each ADC .

Results will be \npresented today as a late-breaking oral presentation  (LBA1000) at the 2024 Ameri can Society of Clinical \nOncology (#ASCO24) Annual Meeting.  \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2  directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by \nDaiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and being jointly developed and commerciali zed by Daiichi Sankyo and \nAstraZeneca ( LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN ).  \n In the primary endpoint analysis of patients with HR positive, HER2 low metastatic breast cancer , \nENHERTU reduced the risk of disease progression or death by  38% versus chemotherapy (hazard ratio \n[HR]: 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51-0.74; p<0.0001). M edian PFS was 13.2 months in  the \nENHERTU arm compared to 8.1 months in the  chemotherapy arm as assessed by blinded independent \ncentral review (BICR) .  \n In the key secondary endpoint analysis of PFS by BICR in the overall trial population , ENHERTU achieved \na similar 37% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death versus chemotherapy with a m edian PFS\n2 \n of 13.2 months in the ENHERTU arm versus 8.1 months with chemotherapy  (HR : 0.63; 95% CI: 0.53- 0.75; \np<0.0001) .  \n \nA prespecified exploratory analysis showed the clinically meaningful improvement in PFS was consistent \nbetween patients with HER2 low and HER2  ultralow expression. In  patients with HER2 ultralow expression, \nENHERTU  showed a 22% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared to chemotherapy \nwith a median PFS of 13.2 months with ENHERTU versus 8.3 months with chemotherapy (HR: 0.78; 95% \nCI: 0.50- 1.21) .  \n In patients with HER2 low expression, confirmed objective response rate ( ORR ) was 56.5% in the \nENHERTU arm with nine complete responses ( CRs) and 194 partial responses ( PRs) versus 32.2% in the \nchemotherapy arm with zero CRs and 114  PRs.  In the overall trial population, c onfirmed ORR  in the \nENHERTU arm  was 57.3% with 13 CRs and 237 PRs versus 31.2% in the chemotherapy  arm with zero CRs \nand 134 PRs. In patients with HER2  ultralow expression, the confirmed ORR in the ENHERTU arm was \n61.8% with four CRs and 43  PRs versus 26.3% in the chemotherapy arm with zero CRs  and 20 PRs.  \n “Endocrine therapies are widely  used early in the treatment of HR positive metastatic breast cancer , but \nfollowing one or more lines of treatment, patients often derive  limited efficacy from  further endocrine -based  \ntherapy,” said  Giuseppe Curigliano, MD, PhD, Professor of Medical Oncology at the University of Milan  \nand the Head of the Division of Early Drug Development  at the European Institute of Oncology, IRCCS, \nItaly and Principal Investigator for the trial . “With a median progression- free survival  of more than a year, \nthe results from DESTINY -Breast06 show that ENHERTU could become a new standard of care for patients \nwith HER2  low and HER2 ultralow expressing tumors  following endocrine therap y in the metastatic setting .”  \n The safety profile of ENHERTU in DESTINY -Breast06 was consistent with previous breast cancer clinical \ntrials with no new safety concerns identified. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment related treatment \nemergent adverse events (TEAE s) occurring in 5% or more of patients treated with ENHERTU were \nneutropenia ( 20.7%), leukopenia  (6.9%) and anemia ( 5.8%). Interstitial lung disease (ILD)  or pneumonitis \noccurred in 11.3% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The majority of ILD  or pneumonitis  events were low \ngrade ( grade 1 [n=7 ; 1.6% ] or grade 2 [n=36; 8.3% ]). There were t hree grade 3 ILD events (0.7%) , zero \ngrade 4 events  and three grade 5 events (0.7 %) as determined by an independent  adjudicat ion committee.  \n \n“ENHERTU continues to deliver pioneering results for a HER2 directed medicine across many differe nt \ntypes of cancer ,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “These latest results from \nDESTINY -Breast06 demonstrate  clinically meaningful results with ENHERTU even in tumors with very \nlow levels  of HER2 expression, suggesting that it  may have an important  role in treating a wide range  of \nHER2 expressing metastatic breast cancer .”\n3 \n “DESTINY -Breast06 represents another potential  paradigm shift in how we t reat patients across the \nspectrum of HR  positive metastatic breast cancer,”  said Susan Galbraith , MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice \nPresident, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “ The results reinforce the potential  for ENHERTU to improve \noutcomes earlier in the treatment landscape and in a broader population of patients with HER2  expressing \nbreast cancer who have never before been eligible for  a HER2  directed therapy.”  \n \nPatients in the DESTINY -Breast06  trial received a median of two prior lines of endocrine therapy in each \ntreatment arm. In the overall trial population, 14.9% of patients (n=65) in the  ENHERTU arm had received \none prior line of endocrine therapy and 67.8% (n=295) had received two prior lines of endocrine therapy. No \npatients in the trial had received prior chemotherapy treatment in the metastatic setting . Median duration of \nfollow-up was 18.2 months. As of the data cut -off of March 18, 2024, a total of 119 patients ( 14.0%) \nremained on study treatment , with 89 (20.5%) receiving  ENHERTU and 30 (7.2%) receiving  chemotherapy. \n Summary of DESTINY -Breast06 Primary Analysis Results  \nEfficacy Measure HER2  low (IHC 1+  and IHC \n2+/ISH -) Overall trial population  \n(HER2  low and HER2  \nultralow ) HER2  ultralow ( defined as \nIHC 0 with membrane \nstaining )i,ii \nENHERTU  \n(n=359)  Chemo therapy  \n(n=354)  ENHERTU  \n(n=436 ) Chemo therapy  \n(n=430)  ENHERTU  \n(n=76)  Chemo therapy  \n(n=76)  \nPFS \nMedian PFSiii \n(months)  \n(95% CI)  13.2 months   8.1 months   13.2 months   8.1 months   13.2 months   8.3 months   \nHR (95% CI)  0.62 (0.51 -0.74)  0.63 (0.53 -0.75)  0.78 (0.50 -1.21)  \np-value  p<0.0001  p<0.0001  --- \nOS \n12 month  OS Rate  \n(%) \n(95% CI)  87.6%  \n 81.7%  \n 87.0% \n 81.1% \n 84.0%  \n 78.7%  \n \nHR (95% CI)  0.83 (0.66 -1.05)  0.81 (0.65 -1.00)v 0.75 (0.43 -1.29)  \np-value  p=0.1181vi --- --- \nORR  \nConfirmed \nORRi,iii,vii (%) ( n) 56.5% (203) 32.2% ( 114) 57.3% ( 250) 31.2% ( 134) 61.8% ( 47) 26.3% ( 20) \nBest Overall Response  \nCR % (n)  2.5% (9) 0 3.0% (13)  0 5.3%  (4) 0 \nPR % (n)  54.0% (194) 32.2% (1 14) 54.4% (237)  31.2% (134)  56.6% (43)  26.3% (20)  \nSD % (n) 34.8% (125)  48.0% (170)  33.9% (148)  49.3% (212)  28.9% (22)  55.3% (42)  \nMedian DOR  \n(months)  14.1 months  8.6 months  14.3 months  8.6 months  14.3 months  14.1 months  \nCI, confidence interval; CR, complete response; DOR, duration of response; HR, hazard ratio; NA, not available; PFS, progression -free survival; \nORR, objective response rate; OS, overall survival; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease  \ni Descriptive anal ysis \nii Per central lab  \niii As assessed by BICR  \niv Less than 40% maturity for interim OS analysis  (HER2 low)  \nv No test of significance was performed in line with the multiple testing procedure   \nvi P-value  of 0.0046  required for statistical significance at this OS interim analysis   \nvii ORR is ( CR + PR)\n4 \n  \nAdditional ENHERTU Data at ASCO  \nDESTINY-Breast03 Updated Results  \nUpdated overall survival (OS)  results from the DESTINY- Breast03  phase 3 trial also presented as a poster \nshow ENHERTU continued to demonstrate a cli nically meaningful survival improvement over trastuzumab \nemtansine (T -DM1) after more than three years of follow -up in patients with HER2 positive unresectable \nand/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab. In the updated analysis of OS, the key \nsecondary endpoint of  median  OS has been reached in both treatment arms. Median OS was 52.6 months \n(95% CI: 48.7- NE) in the  ENHERTU arm compared to 42.7 months (95% CI: 35.4- NE) in the  T-DM1 arm \n(HR: 0.73 ; 95% CI: 0.56-0.94).  \n The safety profile of ENHERTU continues to be generally manageable and no cumulative toxicities were observed with longer follow -up. Grade 3 or higher treatment related TEAEs occurred in 48.6% of patients \nreceiving ENHERTU. Since the prior data cut- off, there were four new ILD events (all grade 2).  \n \nDESTINY-Breast07 Results  \nInterim results from the DESTINY- Breast07  phase 1b/2 trial of ENHERTU  alone or in combination with \nother anticancer therapies as a first -line treatment for HER2  positive metastatic breast cancer also were  \npresented as an oral presentation. In the analysis, ENHERTU  demonstrated promising activity  as a \nmonotherapy (n=75) and in combination with pertuzumab (n=50).  \n Confirmed ORR in the ENHERTU monotherapy arm  was 76.0% (80% CI: 68.5-82.4) with six CRs and 51 \nPRs. In the ENHERTU plus pertuzumab combination arm, confirmed ORR was 84.0% (80% CI: 75.3-90.5) \nwith 10 CRs and 32 PRs. The 12-month PFS rate was 80.8% (80% CI: 73.7-86.1) in the ENHERTU \nmonotherapy arm and 89.4% (80% CI: 81.9-93.9) in the ENHERTU plus pertuzumab combination arm.  \n \nThe safety of ENHERTU  as a monotherapy and in combination with pertuzumab was consistent with known \nsafety profiles of each therapy . Grade 3 or higher TEAEs occurred in 52.0 % of pa tients  in the ENHERTU \nmonotherapy arm and 62.0% of patients in the ENHERTU plus pertuzumab combination arm. The most common grade 3 or higher TEAEs occurring in 5% or more of patients were neutropenia  (27.0% in \nENHERTU  monotherapy arm; 24% in ENHERTU plus pertuzumab arm ), anemia (4.0% in ENHERTU \nmonotherapy arm; 14.0% in ENHERTU plus pertuzumab arm) and diarrhea (3 .0% in ENHERTU \nmonotherapy arm; 6.0% in ENHERTU plus pertuzumab arm). The majority of ILD or pneumonitis events \nwere low grade (grade 1 or 2). In the ENHERTU monotherapy arm, there were two (2.7%) grade 1 events and five  (6.7%) grade 2 events. There were no grade 3 or higher events observed in the ENHERTU \nmonotherapy arm. In the ENHERTU plus pertuzumab combination arm, there were six (12.0%) grade 2\n5 \n events  and one  (2.0%)  grade 3 event. There were no grade 4 or 5 events observed in the ENHERTU p lus \npertuzumab combination arm.  \n This is the first dataset of ENHERTU as a first -line treatment of HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer. \nAnalyses from the ongoing DESTINY -Breast09  phase 3 trial will provide further insights regarding the \nefficacy and safety of ENHERTU  in this HER2  positive patient population.  \n About D ESTINY -Breast06  \nDESTINY -Breast06 is a global, randomized, open- label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of  \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) versus investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, paclitaxel or nab paclitaxel) in patients with HR positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 ultralow (defined as  \nIHC 0 with membr ane staining ) advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Patients in the trial had  no prior \nchemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease and received at least two lines of  prior endocrine therapy in \nthe metastatic setting. Patients  also were eligible if they  had received one prior line  of endocrine therapy \ncombined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the metastatic setting and experienced disease progression within six months of starting first- line treatment or received endocrine therapy as an adjuvant treatment and \nexperienced disease recurrence within 24 months . \n The primary endpoint is PFS in the HR positive, HER2 low patient population as measured by BICR. Key secondary endpoints include PFS by BICR  in the overall trial population (HER2 low and HER2 ultralow) , \nOS in patients in the  HER2 low  patient population and OS in the overall trial population. Other  secondary \nendpoints include ORR , DOR , time to first subsequent treatment  or death, time to second subsequent \ntreatment or death and safety. Analysis of the HER2 ultralow subgroup was not powered to demonstrate \nstatistical significance.  \n \nDESTINY -Breast06 enrolled 866 patients (n=713 for HER2 low and n=153 for HER2 ultralow) at multiple  \nsites in Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and South America. For more information about the trial, visit  \nClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout D ESTINY -Breast03  \nDESTINY -Breast03 is a global, head -to-head, randomized, open- label, pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating the  \nefficacy and  safety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) versus T -DM1 in patients with HER2 positive unresectable  \nand/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane.  \n The primary efficacy  endpoint of DESTINY -Breast03 is PFS based on BICR. OS is the  key secondary \nefficacy outcome measure.  Other secondary endpoints include ORR, D OR, PFS based on investigator \nassessment and safety.\n6 \n  \nDESTINY -Breast03 enrolled 524 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and \nSouth America. Primary results from DESTINY -Breast03 were published in The New England Journal of \nMedicine, with updated OS results published in The Lancet . For more information about the trial, visit \nClinicalTrials.g ov. \n \nAbout DESTINY- Breast07  \nDESTINY -Breast07 is a global, randomized, open- label  phase 1b/2 dose-finding and dose -expansion trial to \nexplore the safety, tolerability and antitumor activity of ENHERTU alone or in combinati on with other \nanticancer agents in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.  The study consist s of two  phases: \na dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. The dose escalation phase enrolled patients with locally assessed HER2 positive or advanced metastatic breast cancer in second -line or later  treatment . The dose \nexpansion phase enrolled patients with locally assessed HER2  positive breast cancer  previously untreated for \nadvanced or metastatic disease.  \n \nThe primary endpoint s of DESTINY -Breast0 7 are safety and tolerability . Secondary endpoints include ORR  \nand PFS based on investigator assessment.   \n DESTINY -Breast07 enrolled 244 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe, North America  and South \nAmerica.  For more information  about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n About Breast C ancer and HER2 E xpression  \nBreast  cancer is  the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related death s \nworldwide.\n1 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022 with more than 66 5,000 \ndeaths globally .1 While survival rates are high for those diagnosed with early breast cancer, only about  30% \nof patients diagnosed with or who progress to metastatic disease are expected to live five years f ollowing \ndiagnosis .2 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth- promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors, including breast cancer .3 Patients with high levels of HER2 expression (IHC 3+ or IHC2+/ISH+) are \nclassified as HER2  positive and treated with HER2 targeted therapies , representing  approximately 15 to 20% \npercent of all breast cancers .4 Historically, tumors that were not classified as HER2  positive were classified \nas HER2  negative , despite t he fact that many of these tumors still carry some level of HER2 expression.5  \nIt is estimated that approximately 60% to 65%  of HR  positive  breast cancers are HER2  low and potentially \nan additional  25% may be HER2  ultralow.6,7\n7 \n Endocrine therapies are widely given consecutively in the early lines of treatment for HR  positive metastatic \nbreast cancer . However, following two lines of endoc rine therapy, further efficacy with additional endocrine \ntreatment  is often limited. 8 The current standard of care following endocrine therapy is chemotherapy, which \nis associated with poor r esponse rates and outcomes. 8,9,10,11 \n \nPrior to the approval of ENHERTU following chemotherapy in HER2 low metastatic breast cancer based on \nthe DESTINY -Breast04 trial, there were no targeted therapies approved specifically for patients with HER2 \nlow expression .12 There are no targeted therapies specifically approved for patients with HER2 ultralow  \nexpression.13  \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 60 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or in-situ hybridization (ISH)+) breast cancer who \nhave received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or \nadjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy \nbased on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 60 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ (ISH) -) breast cancer who have received a \nprior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 35 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2  (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results \nfrom th e DESTINY -Lung02 trial. Continued approval in the U.S. for this indication may be contingent upon \nverification and description of c linical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 45 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+)\n gastric or gastroesophageal\n8 \n junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior tr astuzumab -based regimen based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Gastric01  and/or DESTINY -Gastric02  trials.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic treatment and have no \nsatisfactory alternative treatment options based on efficacy results from the DESTINY -PanTumor02, \nDESTINY -Lung01 \nand DESTINY -CRC02  trials. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent \nupon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global  clinical  development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers. Trials in combination with other \nanticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  \n About the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights  for eac h ADC . Daiichi Sank yo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of  \nENHERTU and  datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nAbout  the DXd  ADC Portfolio of  Daiichi  Sankyo  \n \nThe DXd  ADC  portfolio of  Daiichi  Sankyo currently  consists  of six ADCs  in clinical  development  across  \nmultiple  types  of cancer.  ENHERTU,  a HER2  directed  ADC,  and datopotamab deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd),  a \nTROP2  directed  ADC,  are being jointly  developed and comme rcialized  globally with  AstraZeneca.  \nPatritumab  deruxtecan  (HER3 -DXd),  a HER3  directed  ADC,  ifinatamab  deruxtecan  (I-DXd),  a B7-H3 \ndirected  ADC,  and raludotatug deruxtecan  (R-DXd),  a CDH6  directed  ADC,  are being  jointly  developed and \ncommercialized  globall y with  Merck  & Co.,  Inc., Rahway,  N.J.

Co ntinued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH positive) gastric or \ngastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab- based regimen  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive (IHC3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic \ntreatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY  \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsen ing respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise pati ents of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  Warnings and Precautions \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients\n10 \n treated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day pre dnisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.   \nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5  months (range: \n0.9 to  31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonit is occurred in 1.0% of patients treated with \nENHERTU.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8  months (range: \n1.2 to  21). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHE RTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC \n<1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce do se by one level.  \n \nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 63% of patients. Seventeen percent had Grade 3 or  4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n22 days (range: 2 to 939). Febrile neutropenia was report ed in 1% of patients. \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty- one percent had \nGrade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \nLeft Ventricular Dysfun ction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of EN HERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40- 45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not reco vered to within 10% from\n11 \n baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume \ntreatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is \n>20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVE F assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU \nhas not bee n studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to \ninitiation of treatment.  \n \nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patient s with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 3.8% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3. \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHE RTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nHER2 -Positive and HER2- Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \n1799 patients in Study DS8201-A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY- Breast01, DESTINY -Breast02, \nDESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -Breast04, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY-Lung02, DESTINY-CRC02, and \nDESTINY -PanTumor02.

Advise patients \nof the potential risks to a f etus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant \nwomen, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions \nin a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months \nafter the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reprodu ctive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females \nof reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can \ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive pote ntial to \nuse effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 month s after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 1287 patients with HER2-positive or H ER2-low breast cancer treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 years and 3.8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. \nThere was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (59%) \nas compared to younger patients (49%). Of the 101 patients with HER2- mutant unresectable or \nmetastatic NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ \nadenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and \n14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2-positive (IHC 3+) \nunresectable o r metastatic solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-PanTumor02, \nDESTINY -Lung01, or DESTINY-CRC02, 39% were 65 years or older and 9% were 75 years or older. \nNo overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 year s of age compared \nto younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The\n15 \n recommended dosa ge of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n Please see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the world.

    "content": "1 \n  \n \n \nPress Release  \n \nENHERTU® Demonstrated Statistically Significant and Clinically \nMeaningful Improvement in Progression -Free Survival in HR  Positive, \nHER2  Low Metastatic Breast Cancer  Following One or More Lines of \nEndocrine Therapy  in DESTINY -Breast06 Phase 3 Trial  \n \n• Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s ENHERTU also demonstrated a clinically meaningful progression -\nfree survival improvement in patients with HER2 ultralow expression  \n• Plans for global regulatory submissions are under way \n \nTokyo  and Basking Ridge, NJ – (April 29, 202 4) – Positive t opline results from the DESTINY -Breast06  \nphase 3 trial showed that ENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan) demonstrated a statistically significant and \nclinically meaningful improvement in progression -free survival (PFS) compared to standard of care \nchemotherapy in the primary trial population of patients with HR positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC \n2+/ISH -) metastatic breast cancer  following one or more lines of endocrine therapy.  \n \nA statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS  also was observed in the overall trial \npopulation ( patients with HER2 low and HER2 ultralow [defined as IHC 0 with membrane staining; IHC >0  \n<1+] metastatic breast cancer ). A pre -specified subgroup analysis showed that t he clinically meaningful \nimprovement was consistent between  patients with HER2 low and HER2 ultralow expression .  \n \nOverall survival (OS) data were not mature  at the time of the analysis. However, ENHERTU showed a n early  \ntrend towards an OS improvement versus standard of care  chemotherapy in patients with HER2 low \nmetastatic breast cancer  and in the overall trial population. The trial will continue as planned t o further assess \nOS and other  secondary endpoints.  \n \nENHERTU  is a specifically engineered HER2 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by \nDaiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and being jointly developed and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo and \nAstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN).  \n \nIt is estimated that approximately 60% to 65% of HR positive , HER2 negative  breast cancers are HER2 low \nand potentially an additional  25% may be HER2 ultralow.1,2 Endocrine therapies are widely u sed in the early \nlines of treatment for HR positive metastatic breast cancer . However , after two lines of treatment , further \nefficacy from endoc rine therapy is often limited .3 The current standard of care following endocrine therapy is \nchemotherapy, which is  associated with poor response rates and outcomes.3,4,5,6\n2 \n  \n“The topline results from DESTINY -Breast06 highlight the importance of continuing to challenge current \ntreatment paradigms and established breast cancer classifications to evolve how we treat patients with HR \npositive , HER2 expressing metastatic breast cancer ,\" said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi \nSankyo. “ Building on the practice -chang ing data seen in DESTINY -Breast04, these results  reinforce the \npotential  for use of ENHERTU  earlier in the treatment landscape and in an even broader patient population.”  \n \n“DESTINY -Breast06 shows that ENHERTU could  become a new standard of care  for patients with HER2 \nlow and HER2 ultralow  metastatic breast cancer following  one or more lines of endocrine therapy,” said \nSusan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “ These data \nunderscore the potential  for treatment with ENHERTU  across  the spectrum of HR positive breast cancer, \nfurther redefining the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. ”  \n \nThe safety profile of ENHERTU was consistent with previous breast cancer clinical trials with no new safety \nsignals identified.   \n \nData from DESTINY -Breast06  will be presented at an upcoming  medical meeting and shared with  global \nregulatory authorities.  \n \nAbout DESTINY -Breast06   \nDESTINY -Breast06 is a global, randomi zed, open -label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) versus investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, paclitaxel or nab -\npaclitaxel) in patients with HR positive, HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) or HER2 ultralo w (defined as \nIHC 0 with membrane staining [ IHC >0  <1+]) advanced or metastatic breast cancer . Patients in the trial had \nno prior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease and either experienced disease progression within  \nsix months of starting first -line treatment with an endocrine therapy combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor or \nreceived at least two previous lines of endocrine therap y in the metastatic setting.  \n \nThe primary endpoint is PFS in the HR  positive, HER2  low patie nt population as measured by blinded \nindependent central review (BICR). Key s econdary endpoints include OS in patients with HER2 low \nexpression and PFS by BICR and OS in the overall trial  population (HER2 low and HER2 ultralow). Other \nsecondary endpoints i nclude objective response rate, duration of response , time to first subsequent treatment \nor death , time to second subsequent treatment or death and safety. Analysis of the HER2 ultralow subgroup \nwas not powered to demonstrate statistical significance.\n3 \n DESTINY -Breast06 enrolled 866 patients  (n=713  for HER2 low  and n= 153 for HER2 ultralow ) at multiple \nsites in Asia, Europe, North America and South America. For more information about the trial, visit \nClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Breast Cancer and HER2 Expression  \nBreast  cancer is  the second most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.7  More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2022 with more than 665,000 \ndeaths globally .7 While survival rates are high for those diagnosed with  early breast cancer, only \napproximately 30% of patients who are diagnosed with or progress to metastatic disease are expected to live \nfive years after their diagnosis .8 \n \nHR positive, HER2  negative is the most common breast cancer subtype, accounting for approximately 70% of \nall breast cancers.8 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of \nmany types of tumors, including breast cancer .9 Patients with high levels of HER2 expression (IHC 3+ or \nIHC2+/ ISH+) are classified as HER2  positive and treated with HER2  targeted therapies , representing \napproximately 15 to 20% percent of all breast cancers .10 Historically, tumors that were not classified as HER2  \npositive were classified as HER2  negative; however, many of these tumors still carry  some level of HER2 \nexpression.11 It is estimated that approximately 60%  to 65%  of HR  positive , HER2 negative  breast cancers are \nHER2  low and potentially an additional  25% may be HER2  ultralow.1,2 \n \nPrior to the approval of ENHERTU in HER2 low metastatic breast cancer post chemotherapy  based on the \nDESTINY -Breast04 trial, there were no targeted therapies approve d specifically for patients with HER2 low \nexpression .12 There are no  targeted  therapies specifically approved for patients with HER2 ultralow \nexpression .13  \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads (an exatec an derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 60 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or  IHC 2+/ in-situ hybridization (ISH)+) breast cancer \nwho have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or\n4 \n adjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy \nbased on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 55 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ (ISH) -) breast cancer who have received a \nprior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 35 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2  (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results \nfrom th e DESTINY -Lung02  trial. Continued approval in the U.S. for this indication may be contingent upon \nverification and description of c linical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 45 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+)  gastric or gastroesophageal \njunctio n (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Gastric01  and/or DESTINY -Gastric02  trials.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic treatment and have no \nsatisfactory alternative treatment options based on efficacy results from the DESTINY -PanTumor02 , \nDESTINY -Lung01  and DESTINY -CRC02  trials. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent \nupon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global  clinical  development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers. Trials in combination with other \nanticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019  and datopotamab deruxtecan in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights  for eac h ADC . Daiichi Sank yo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of  \nENHERTU and  datopotamab deruxtecan.\n5 \n About  the DXd  ADC  Portfolio  of Daiichi  Sankyo   \nThe DXd  ADC  portfolio  of Daiichi  Sankyo  currently  consists  of six ADCs  in clinical  development  across  \nmultiple  types  of cancer.

Continued approval for this indication may be con tingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk an d to immediately \nreport symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pne umonitis  \nSevere, life -threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment . Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new \nor worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imag ing. Consider consultation with a \npulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, \nthen if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dos e one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic cort icosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant  NSCLC, and Solid Tumors (Including \nIHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5  months (range: \n0.9 to 31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 1.0% of patients treated with \nENHERTU.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or  GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8  months (range: \n1.2 to 21). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. For \nGrade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, t hen maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC\n7 \n <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for m ore than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors (Including \nIHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 63% of patients. Seventeen percent had \nGrade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil coun t was 22  days \n(range: 2  to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1% of patients.  \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treate d with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty -one percent had \nGrade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16  days \n(range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutrop enia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 ther apies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, co ntinue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment \nwithin 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt ENHERTU \nand repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, \npermanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with \nENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute d ecrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from \nbaseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \npatients with symptomat ic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in \npatients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NS CLC, and Solid Tumors (Including \nIHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 3.8% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade  3. \n \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, o n \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade  2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of fe males of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of repro ductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.\n8 \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nHER2 -Positive and HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in 1799 \npatients in Study DS8201 -A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast02, DESTINY -\nBreast03, DESTINY -Breast04, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY -Lung02, DESTINY -CRC02, and DESTINY -\nPanTumor02.

Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, \nor if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in \na breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months \nafter the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing : Verify pregnancy status of females \nof reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use \neffective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with fema le partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of EN HERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 1287 patients with HER2 -positive or HER2 -low breast cancer treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 years and 3.8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy \nwithin cl inical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. \nThere was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (59%) \nas compared to younger patients (49%). Of the 101 patients wi th HER2 -mutant unresectable or metastatic \nNSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75 years. No overall \ndifferences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger \npatients. Of the 125 patients with HER2 -positive locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ \nadenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and \n14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between pati ents ≥65 \nyears of age compared to younger patients. Of the 192 patients with HER2 -positive (IHC 3+) \nunresectable or metastatic solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -PanTumor02, \nDESTINY -Lung01, or DESTINY -CRC02, 39% were 65 years or older a nd 9% were 75 years or older. \nNo overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to \nyounger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moder ate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor, DXd. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic impairment \n(total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA -1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide .\n12 \n About Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contribut ing to the sustainable development of \nsociety that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the \nworld.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate \n(ORR)  and duration of response (DOR) . Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon \nverification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\nE\nNHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by \nDaiichi Sankyo and being jointly developed and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca. \nThe\n first tumor agnostic approval of a HER2 directed therapy and ADC was based on efficacy data in 192 \nadult patients with previously treated unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who \nwere enrolled in one of three multicenter phase 2 trials from the DESTINY clinical development program, including DESTINY -PanTumor02, DESTINY -Lung01 or DESTINY -CRC02 . The major efficacy outcome \nmeasure in all three of the studies was confirmed ORR and an additional efficacy outcome measure was DOR.  \nI\nn DESTINY -PanTumor02, efficacy was assessed in a subgroup of previously treated pati ents (n=111) with \ncentrally or locally assessed HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors including either biliary tract, bladder, cervical, endometrial, ovarian, pancreatic or other tumors. Confirmed ORR was 51.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] : 41.7-61.0) and median DOR range was 19.4 months (range: 1.3 , 27.9+ [‘+’ denotes ongoing \nresponses at data cutoff] ). In DESTINY -Lung01, efficacy was assessed in a subgroup of patients (n=17) with \ncentrally confirmed HER2 positive (IHC 3+) non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A confirmed ORR of\n2 52.9% (95% CI: 27.8-77.0) and median DOR range of 6.9 months (range : 4.0, 11.7+ ) was seen. In \nDESTINY -CRC02, efficacy was as sessed in the subgroup of patients (n=64) with centrally confirmed HER2 \npositive (IHC 3+) colorectal cancer. Confirmed ORR was 46.9% (95% CI: 34.3-59.8) and median DOR \nrange was 5.5 months ( range : 1.3+, 9.7+ ). \nT\nhe approval was received following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s ( FDA ) review of the \napplication using the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR)  program and under Priority Review  and \nBreakthrough Therapy Designation. The submission was reviewed under Project Orbis, which provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology medicines among participating international partners. As part of Project O rbis, ENHERTU  also is under regulatory review for the same indication by \nregulatory authorities in Australia, Brazil  and Singapore.  \n“U\nntil the approval of trastuzumab deruxtecan, patients with metastatic HER2 positive solid tumors have had \nlimited treatm ent options, ” said Funda Meric -Bernstam, MD, Chair of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics at \nThe University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. “ Based on the clinically meaningful response rates \nseen across clinical trials, this tumor -agnostic approval means that patients may now be treated with a HER2  \ndirected medicine.” \nEN\nHERTU  is approved with Boxed WARNINGS for interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis and \nEmbryo -Fetal toxicity. The safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 347 adult patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic HER2 positive (IHC  3+) solid tumors who received ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) in DESTINY -\nBreast01 , DESTINY -PanTumor02, DESTINY -Lung01 and DESTINY -CRC02 . The most common adverse \nreactions (frequency ≥20%), including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased white blood cell count, \nnausea, decreased hemoglobin, decreased neutrophil count, fatigue, decreased lymphocyte count, decreased platelet count, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased blood alkaline phosphatase, vomiting, decreased appetite, alopecia, diarrhea, decreased blood potassium, constipation, decreased sodium, stomatitis, and upper respiratory tract infection. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 34% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who recei ved \nENHERTU were sepsis, pneumonia, vomiting, urinary tract infection, abdominal pain, nausea, pneumonitis, pleural effusion, hemorrhage, COVID-19, fatigue, acute kidney injury, anemia, cellulitis, and dyspnea. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 6.3% of patients including ILD/pneumonitis (2.3%), cardiac arrest (0.6%), COVID -19 (0.6%), and sepsis (0.6%). The following events occurred in one patient each \n(0.3%): acute kidney injury, cerebrovascular accident, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and \nhemorrhagic shock.\n3 “This fifth indication in the U.S. is a significant milestone as eligible patients with previously treated \nmetastatic HER2 positive solid tumors may now be treated with ENHERTU,” said Ken Keller, Global Head \nof Oncology Business, and President and CEO, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. “ The accelerated approval by the FDA \nfor this tumor agnostic indication is based on the clinically meaningful efficacy seen with ENHERTU across \nnumerous types of meta static cancers .” \n“\nAs the first antibody drug conjugate to be granted a tumor agnostic indication, ENHERTU is truly \ndelivering on its potential across  metastatic  HER2 targetable tumors,” said Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice \nPresident, Oncology Business Unit, AstraZeneca. “This approval also elevates the importance of testing for \nbiomarkers, including HER2, across a broad range of tumors to ensure these patients with ad vanced cancer \nwho have few options know whether a targeted medicine  might be right for them.”  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca are committed to ensuring that patients in the U.S. who are prescribed ENHERTU can access the medication and receive necessary financial support. Provider and patient support, reimbursement and distribut ion for ENHERTU in the U.S. will be accessible by visiting  \nwww.ENHERTU4U.com  or calling 1-833- ENHERTU (1 -833-364-3788). \nP\nlease visit www.ENHERTU.com  for full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and \nMedication Guide . \nB\nased on these results, fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki (ENHERTU) has been included in  the NCCN \nClinical Practic e Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) as a treatment option for multiple metastatic \ntumors. See NCCN G uidelines® for detailed recommendations.1  \nA\nbout DESTINY-PanTumor02  \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 is a global, multicenter, multi -cohort, open- label phase 2 trial evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) for the treatment of previously treated HER2 expressing tumors, including biliary tract, bladde r, cervical, endometrial, ovarian, pancreatic cancer or other tumors. \n \nThe primary efficacy endpoint of DESTINY-PanTumor02 is confirmed ORR as assessed by investigator. \nSecondary endpoints include DOR, disease control rate (DCR), progression- free survival (PFS), overall \nsurvival (OS), safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics. DESTINY-PanTumor02 enrolled 267 patients, \nincluding 111 HER2 positive (IHC 3+) adult patients, at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America. For more information about the tria l, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.\n4 The primary analysis of this study was presented  in a late- breaking mini -oral session at the 2023 European \nSociety for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress and simultaneously published in the Journal of Clinical \nOncology . \nAb\nout DESTINY- Lung01  \nDESTINY -Lung01 is  a global phase 2, open- label, two -cohort trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg and 5.4 mg/kg) in patients with HER2  mutant (cohort 2, n=91) or HER2 \noverexpressing (defined as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+) (cohort 1 and 1a, n=90) unresectable or metastatic NSCLC \nwho had progressed after one or more systemic therapies. The primary endpoint is confirmed ORR by independent central review. Key secondary endpoints include DOR, DCR, P FS, OS and safety. DESTINY -\nLung01 enrolled 181 patients , including 17 HER2 positive ( IHC 3+ ) adult patients,  at multiple sites, \nincluding Asia, Europe and North America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.  \nF\null results from the HER2 mutant cohort were presented  at the 2021 ESMO Congress and simultaneously \npublished in The New England Journal of Medicine . Updated results from both cohorts of DESTINY-\nLung01 were presented  at the 2022 ESMO Congress. Full results from the HER2 overexpressing cohort were \npublished in The Lancet Oncology  in March 2024.  \nAb\nout DESTINY- CRC02  \nDESTINY -CRC02 is a global, randomized, two arm, parallel, multicenter phase 2 trial evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of two doses (5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg) of ENHERTU in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive colorectal cancer of BRAF wild- type, RAS wild -type or RAS \nmutant tumor types previously treated with standard therapy. The trial was conducted in two stages. In the \nfirst stage, patients (n=80) were randomized 1:1 to receive either 5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg of ENHERTU. In \nthe second stage, additional patients (n=42) were enrolled in the 5.4 mg/kg arm. The primary endpoint is confirmed ORR as assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints include DOR, DCR, investigator -assessed confirmed ORR, clinical benefit ratio,  PFS, OS and safety. DESTINY -CRC02 \nenrolled 122 patients, including 64 HER2 positive (IHC 3+) adult patients, at multiple sites in Asia, Europe \nand North America. For more information about the trial, vis it ClinicalTrials.gov . \nPr\nimary results from the DESTINY -CRC02 phase 2 trial were presented  at the 2023 American Society of \nClinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.\n5 About DESTINY- Breast01  \nDESTINY -Breast01  is a global single- arm, open-label, two-part multicenter phase 2 trial evaluating the \nsafety and efficacy of ENHERTU in patients with HER2 positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast \ncancer previously treated with trastuzumab emtansine (T -DM1). The primary endpoint of the trial is ORR, as \ndetermined by independent central review. Secondary objectives include DOR, DCR, clinical benefit rate, \nPFS, OS  and safety . DESTINY -Breast01 enrolled 253 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and North \nAmerica. Fo r more information about the trial, vis it ClinicalTrials.gov . \nUp\ndated data from DESTINY- Breast01 were presented  at the ESMO 2021 Virtual Congress. The initial \nanalysis was presented at SABCS 2019 and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of \nMedicine in December 2019.  \nA\nbout HER2 Expression in Solid Tumors  \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of various tissue cells \nthroughout the body and is involved in normal cell growth.2,3 In some cancers, HER2 expression is  amplified \nor the cells  have activating mutations .2,4 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a result of HER2  gene \namplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis.5  \nHER2 directed therapies have been used to treat breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers for a number of \nyears. Although HER2 is expressed in solid tumor types including biliary tract, bladder, cervical, \nendometrial, ovarian and pancreatic cancers,4 testing is not routinely performed in these additional tumor \ntypes and as a result, available literature is limited. In these solid tumors, HER2 positive expression, \nclassified as IHC  3+, has been observed at rates from 1% to 28% .6,7 Approximately 1% to 5% of patients \nwith NSCLC have tumors with HER2 overexpression (IHC 3+), however, the levels of protein expression \nreported vary in the literature.6,8 Approximately 1% to 4% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have \ntumors that are HER2 overexpressing (IHC  3+).6,9,10 \nA\nbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU  (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, ENHERTU  is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU  consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a  number of  topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads ( an exatecan derivative,  DXd)  via tetrapeptide- based cleavable linkers.\n6 ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 60 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or in-situ hybridization (ISH)+) breast cancer who \nhave received a prior anti- HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoa djuvant or \nadjuvant setting, and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy \nbased on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \nEN\nHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 55 countries worldwide  for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ (ISH) -) breast cancer who have received a \nprior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of compl eting adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \nEN\nHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 35 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients  \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2  (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results \nfrom the  DESTINY -Lung02 trial. Continued approval in the U.S. for this indication may be contingent upon \nverification and description of cli nical benefit in a confirmatory trial.   \nEN\nHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 45 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+)  gastric or gastroesophageal \njunction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab- based regimen based on the results \nfrom the DESTINY -Gastric01  and/or DESTINY -Gastric02  trials.  \nE\nNHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+) solid tumors who have received prior systemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options based on efficacy results from the DESTINY -PanTumor02, \nDESTINY -Lung01 and DESTINY- CRC02  trials.  Continued approval for this indication may be contingent \nupon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. \nAb\nout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program \nA comprehensive global clinical  development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underwa y.\n7 About the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU  in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU  and datopotamab deruxtecan. \nA\nbout  the DXd  ADC Portfolio of  Daiichi  Sankyo   \nThe DXd  ADC  portfolio of  Daiichi  Sankyo currently  consists of six  ADCs  in clinical  development  across  \nmultiple  types  of cancer.

A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Cons ider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose one lev el. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroi d treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, a nd Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 12% of patients. Median time to first onset was 5.5  months (range: \n0.9 to  31.5). Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 1.0% of patients treated with WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY  \n•Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported wit h\nE\nNHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspne a,\nf\never, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in\nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately\nreport symptoms.\n•Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm.  Advise patients of thes e\nri\nsks and the need for effective contraception.\n9 ENHERTU.  \nHER2 -P ositive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8  months (range: \n1.2 to  21). \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \nc\nomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC \n<1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level.  \nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 63% of patients. Seventeen percent \nhad Grade 3 or  4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n22 days (range: 2 to 939). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1% of patients. \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/k g, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty- one percent had \nGrade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \nL\neft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment \nwithin 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40- 45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from \nbaseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is \n>20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute\ndecrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently\ndiscontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU\nhas not been stud ied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to\ninitiation of treatment.\nHER2 -Positive or HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with  metastatic breast cancer, HER2 -mutant NSCLC, and other solid tumors treated with \nENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 3.8% of patients, of which 0.6% were Grade 3. \nHER2 -Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)\n10 In pat ients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrea se in LVEF.  \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment wit h ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \nA\ndditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 throm bocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by one level.  \nAdverse Reactions  \nHER2 -Positive and HER2- Low Metastatic Breast Cancer, HER2 -Mutant NSCLC, and Solid Tumors \n(Including IHC 3+) (5.4 mg/kg) \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \n1799 patients in Study DS8201-A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY- Breast01, DESTINY -Breast02, \nDESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -Breast04, DESTINY -Lung01, DESTINY-Lung02, DESTINY-CRC02, and \nDESTINY -PanTumor02.

In the trial, \ndatopotamab deruxtecan demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement for \nthe dual primary endpoint of progression- free survival (PFS) compared to investigator’s choice of \nchemotherapy in patients with unresectable or metastatic HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer \npreviously treated with endocrine -based therapy and at least one systemic therapy. For the dual primary \nendpoint of overall survival (OS), interim results numerically favored datopotamab deruxtecan over \nchemoth erapy  but were  not mature  at the time of data cut -off. The trial is  ongoing and OS will be assessed at \nfuture analyses . The safety profile of datopotamab deruxtecan was consistent with that observed in other \nongoing trials with no new safety concerns ident ified.  The most common grade 3 or higher treatment -related \nadverse events in the datopotamab deruxtecan and chemotherapy arms, respectively, were neutropenia (1% \nvs. 31%), stomatitis (6% vs. 3%), fatigue (2% vs. 2%) and anemia (1% vs. 2%).\n2 \n “The FDA’s acceptance of the BLA brings us closer to providing patients with previously treated HR \npositive, HER2 negative breast cancer an alternative option to conventional chemotherapy earlier in the \nmetastatic setting,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, D aiichi Sankyo. “Following our recently \naccepted application for advanced nonsquamous non- small cell lung cancer in the U.S., along with additional \nregulatory reviews underway in China, the EU, Japan and other regions, we are working swiftly to bring \ndatopo tamab deruxtecan as a potential new treatment option to patients around the world.”  \n \n“Despite marked progress in the treatment of HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, most patients with \nadvanced disease develop endocrine resistance and face the prospect of one or several lines of \nchemotherapy,”  said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, \nAstraZeneca. “ If approved, datopotamab deruxtecan has the potential to provide these patients an efficacious \nand better tolerated alter native to conventional chemotherapy.”    \n \nAn additional BLA for datopotamab deruxtecan based on results from the pivotal TROPION -Lung01 phase 3 \ntrial is under review in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received prior systemic therapy. Additional \nregulatory submissions for datopotamab de ruxtecan in lung and breast cancer are underway globally.  \n About TROPION -Breast 01 \nTROPION -Breast01  is a global, randomized, multicenter, open- label phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and \nsafety of datopotamab deruxtecan versus investigator’s choice of single -agent chemotherapy (eribulin, \ncapecitabine, vinorelbine or gemcitabine) in patients with unresectable or metastatic H R positive, HER2 \nnegative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have progressed on and are not suitable for \nendocrine therapy per investigator assessment and have received at least one additional systemic therapy for \nunresectable or metastatic d isease.  \n The dual primary endpoints of TROPION -Breast01 are PFS as assessed by blinded independent central \nreview and OS . Key secondary endpoints include objective response rate, duration of response , investigator -\nassessed PFS,  disease control rate,  time to first subsequent therapy  and safety . TROPION -Breast01 enrolled \nmore than 700 patients in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America . For more information \nvisit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Hormone Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative Breast Cancer  \nMore than 275,000 breast cancer cases were diagnosed in the U.S. in 2022 .\n1  HR positive, HER2 negative \nbreast cancer is the most common subtype, accounting for more than 65% of diagnosed cases.2 Breast  cancer \nis considered HR  positive, HER2 negative when tumors test positive for estrogen and/or progesterone\n3 \n hormone receptors and negative for HER2 (measured as HER2 score of IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -).2,3 \nStandard initial treatment for this subtype of breast cancer is endocrine therapy but most patients with \nadvanced disease will develop resistance, underscoring the need for additional options .4,5 \n TROP2 is a protein broadly expressed in HR  positive, HER2 negative breast cancer  and is associated with \nincreased tumor progression and poor survival .\n6,7 \n  \nAbout Datopotamab Deruxtecan (Dato- DXd)  \nDatopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) is an investigational TR OP2 directed ADC.

For more information visit ClinicalTrials.gov .\n3 \n  \nAbout Advanced Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer  \nNearly 500,000 lung cancer cases were diagnosed in Europe in 2022.6 NSCLC is the most common type of \nlung cancer, accounting for about 80% of  cases .1 Approximately 70% and 30% of NSCLC tumors are of \nnonsquamous or squamous histology, respectively .2  While immunotherapy and targeted therapies have \nimproved outcomes in th e first -line setting, most patients eventually experience disease progression and \nreceive chemotherapy.3,4,5 For decades, chemotherapy has been the last treatment available for patients with \nadvanced NSCLC , despite limited effectiveness and known side effects.3,4,5  \n \nAbout Hormone Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative Breast Cancer  \nMore than 500,000 breast cancer cases were diagnosed in Europe in 2022 .6 HR positive, HER2 negative breast \ncancer is the most common subtype, accounting for more than 65% of diagnosed cases.7 Breast cancer is \nconsidered HR positive, HER2 negative when tu mors test positive for estrogen and/or progesterone hormone \nreceptors and negative for HER2 (measured as HER2 score of IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -).7,8 Standard \ninitial treatment for this subtype of breast cancer is endocrine therapy but most patients wi th advanced disease \nwill develop resistance, underscoring the need for additional options.9,10  \n \nAbout TROP2  \nTROP2 is a protein broadly expressed in several solid tumors, including the majority of NSCLC and HR \npositive, HER2 negative breast cancer  cases .11,12 High TROP2 expression is associated with increased tumor \nprogression and poor survival.12,13 There is currently no TROP2 directed ADC approved for the treatment of \nlung cancer.14,15  \n \nAbout Datopotamab Deruxtecan (Dato -DXd)  \nDatopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) is an investigational TROP2 directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi  \nSankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Techn ology, datopotamab deruxtecan is one of six DXd ADCs in the \noncology  pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanced programs in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific  platform. Datopotamab deruxtecan is comprised of a humanized anti -TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal \nantibody,  developed in collaboration with Sapporo Medical University, attached to a number of  topoisomerase \nI inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n \nA comprehensive development program called TROPION is underway globally with more than 1 4 trials  \nevaluating the efficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan across multiple cancers , including NSCLC, \ntriple negative breast cancer and HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. Beyond the TROPION prog ram, \ndatopotamab deruxtecan also is being evaluated in novel combinations in several ongoing trials.\n4 \n  \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commerc ialize \nENHERTU  in March 2019  and datopotamab  deruxtecan in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manuf acturing and supply of \nENHERTU  and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nAbout  the DXd  ADC  Portfolio  of Daiichi  Sankyo   \nThe DXd  ADC  portfolio  of Daiichi  Sankyo  currently  consists  of six ADCs  in clinical  development  across  \nmultiple  types  of cancer.

    "content": "1 \n \n \n \n \nPress Release  \n \nENHERTU® Granted Priority Review in the U.S. for Patients with \nMetastatic HER2 Positive Solid Tumors  \n \n• Application based on results from DESTINY-P anTumor02 trial and supported by additional ENHERTU \ndata  \n• Submission to be reviewed under FDA Real Time Oncology Review and Project Orbis  \n• If approved, Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s ENHERTU will potentially be the first HER2 directed \ntreatment and antibody drug conjugate to receive a tumor agnostic indication  \n \nTokyo and Basking Ridge, NJ – (January 29, 2024)  – Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and AstraZeneca's \n(LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for ENHERTU® (fam-\ntrastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki) has been accepted and granted Priority Review in the U.S. for the treatment of \nadult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+) solid tumors \nwho have received prior treatment or who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.   ENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly developed and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca. \n \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) grants Priority Review to applications for medicines that, if \napproved, would offer significant improvements over available treatment  options by demonstrating safety or \nefficacy improvements, preventing serious conditions or enhancing patient compliance. The Prescription \nDrug User Fee Act  (PDUFA)  date, the FDA action date for their regulatory decision, is  May 30, 2024. The \nPriority Review follows receipt of  Breakthrough Therapy Designation  granted by the FDA in August 2023 \nfor ENHERTU in  metastatic HER2 positive solid tumors . \n The sBLA is being reviewed under the Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) program and Project Orbis, two initiatives of the FDA which are designed to bring safe and effective cancer treatments to patients as early as possible. RTOR allows the FDA to rev iew components of an application before submission of the \ncomplete application. Project Orbis provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology \nmedicines among participating international partners. \n The sBLA  is based on data from the ongoing DESTINY -PanTumor02 phase 2 trial where ENHERTU \ndemonstrated clinically meaningful and durable respo nses leading to a clinically meaningful survival \nbenefit \nin previously treated patients across HER2 expressing advanced solid tumors . Data from other supporting\n2 \n trials in patients with HER2  positive IHC 3+ tumors in the ENHERTU clinical development program, \nincluding DESTINY -Lung01 and DESTINY -CRC02 , also  were  included in the submission.  \n \n“The clinical benefit seen across HER2 expressing metastatic solid tumors in the DESTINY -PanTumor02 \ntrial and ongoing data from the ENHERTU clinical development program continues to demonstrate the \npotential of this medicine beyond its approved indications,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, \nDaiichi Sankyo. “If approved, ENHERTU could become the first HER2 directed therapy and antibody drug \nconjugate with a tumor agnostic indication, providing patients with a potential new treatment option.”  \n \n“Today’s Priority Review for the first tumor agnostic submission for ENHERTU reflects the potential of this \nmedicine to redefine  the treatment of HER2  expressing cancers,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, \nExecutive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZene ca. “Biomarkers for HER2 expression are already \nestablished i n breast and gastric cancers , but we must now define them across tumor types. We will continue \nwork ing closely with the FDA to bring this  potential first tumor agnostic HER2  targeted medicine to patients \nas quickly as possible .”  \n \nAbout DESTINY-PanTumor02  \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 is a global, multicenter, multi -cohort, open- label phase 2 trial evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) for the treatment of previously treated HER2 expressing tumors, including biliary tract, bladder, cervical, endometrial, ovarian, pancreatic cancer or other tumors.  The primary efficacy endpoint of DESTINY-PanTumor02 is confirmed objective response r ate (ORR ) as \nassessed by investigator. Secondary endpoints include duration of response ( DOR ), disease control rate \n(DCR), progression- free survival ( PFS), overall survival ( OS), safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics. \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 enrolled 267 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America. For more \ninformation about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n The primary analysis of this study was presented  in a late- breaking mini -oral session at the 2023 European \nSociety for Medical Oncology (ESMO ) Congress and simultaneously published in the Journal of Clinical \nOncology . \n About DESTINY- Lung01  \nDESTINY -Lung01 is  a global phase 2, open- label, two -cohort trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg and 5.4 mg/kg) in patients with HER2  mutant (cohort 2, n=91) or HER2 \noverexpressing (cohort 1 and 1a, n=90) (defined as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+) unresectable or metastatic non -\nsquamous non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had progressed after one or more systemic therapies. \nThe primary endpoint is confirmed ORR by independent central review. Key secondary endpoints include\n3 \n DOR,  DCR, PFS, OS and safety. DESTINY -Lung01 enrolled 181 patients at multiple sites, including Asia, \nEurope and North America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.  \n \nFull results from the HER2 mutant cohort were presented  at the 2021 ESMO Congress and simultaneously \npublished in The New England Journal of Medicine . Updated results from both cohorts of DESTINY-\nLung01 were presented  at the 2022 ESMO Congress.  \n About DESTINY- CRC02  \nDESTINY -CRC02 is a global, randomized, two arm, parallel, multicenter phase 2 trial evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of two doses (5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg) of ENHERTU in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive colorectal cancer of BRAF wild -type, or RAS  wild -type and RAS \nmutant tumor types previously treated with standard therapy. The trial was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, patients (n=80) were randomized 1:1 to receive either 5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg of ENHERTU. In the second stage, additio nal patients (n=42) were enrolled in the 5.4 mg/kg arm. The primary endpoint is \nconfirmed ORR as assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints include DOR, DCR, investigator -assessed confirmed ORR, clinical benefit ratio, PFS, OS and safety. DESTINY -CRC02 \nenrolled 122 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America. For more information about the trial, vis it ClinicalTrials.gov . \n Primary results from the DESTINY -CRC02 phase 2 trial were presented  at the 2023 American Society of \nClinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.  \n About HER2 Expression in Solid Tumors  \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of various tissue cells \nthroughout the body and is involved in normal cell growth.1,2 In some cancers, HER2 expression is  amplified \nor the cells  have activating mutations .1,3 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a r esult of HER2  gene \namplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis.4 While HER2 directed \ntherapies have been used to treat breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers, more research is needed \nevaluating their potential ro le in treating other HER2 expressing solid tumor types.2,5,6 \n \nHER2 is an emerging biomarker in solid tumor types including  biliary tract, bladder, cervical, endometrial, \novarian and pancreatic cancers.3 Testing is not routinely performed in these additional tumor types and as a \nresult, available literature is limited. In these solid tumors, HER2 positive expression , classified as  IHC 3+ , \nhas been observed at rates from 1% to 28%.7,8\n4 \n There is an unmet  need for effective therapies for certain HER2 expressing solid tumors, particularly for \nthose who have progressed on or are refractory to standard of care therapies as there are currently no \napproved HER2 directed therapies for these cancers.2,9  \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam- trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide- based cleavable linkers.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 55 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior anti -\nHER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic  setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 45 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ in-situ hybridization (ISH)- ) breast cancer \nwho have received a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -\nBreast04  trial. \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2  (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results \nfrom the  DESTINY -Lung02 trial. Continued approval in the U.S. for this indication may be contingent upon \nverification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n ENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult pat ients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the \nDESTINY -Gastric01  and/or DESTINY -Gastric02  trials.\n5 \n  \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program A comprehensive global clinical development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  \n About the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU  in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiic hi Sankyo is responsible for the \nmanufacturing and supply of ENHERTU  and datopotamab deruxtecan. \n About  the DXd  ADC Portfolio of  Daiichi  Sankyo   \nThe DXd  ADC  portfolio of  Daiichi  Sankyo currently  consists of six  ADCs  in clinical  development  across  \nmultiple  types  of cancer.  ENHERTU,  a HER2  directed  ADC,  and datopotamab deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd),  a \nTROP2  directed  ADC,  are being jointly  developed and commercialized  globally with  AstraZeneca.  \nPatritumab  deruxtecan  (HER3 -DXd),  a HER3  directed  ADC,  ifinatamab  deruxtec an (I-DXd),  a B7 -H3 \ndirected  ADC,  and raludotatug deruxtecan  (R-DXd),  a CDH6  directed  ADC,  are being  jointly  developed and \ncommercialized  globally with  Merck  & Co.,  Inc., Rahway,  N.J. USA.  DS-3939, a TA -MUC1  directed  ADC,  \nis being developed by Daiichi  Sank yo.  \n Designed  using Daiichi  Sankyo’s proprietary  DXd  ADC  technology to  target  and deliver a cytotoxic  payload \ninside cancer  cells  that express a specific cell surface antigen, each  ADC  consists of a monoclonal antibody \nattached  to a number of  topoisomeras e I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan  derivative,  DXd)  via tetrapeptide -\nbased  cleavable linkers. \n Datopotamab  deruxtecan,  ifinatamab  deruxtecan,  patritumab  deruxtecan, raludotatug deruxtecan  and        \nDS-3939 are investigational medicines that have  not been  approved  for any indication  in any country. Safety  \nand efficacy  have  not been  established.  \n \nE\nNHERTU U.S. Important Safety Information   \n \nIndications  \n \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based \nregimen either:  \n– In the metastat ic setting, or\n6 \n – In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six \nmonths of completing therapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH- ) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -\napproved test, who have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease \nrecurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2  \n(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test, and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY  \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \nContraindications  \nNone. \n \nWarnings and Precautions Interstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resol ved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomat ic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, ILD \noccurred in 12% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 1.0% of patients treated \nwith ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 5  months (range: 0.9 to 23).\n7 \n Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positiv e gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8  months (range: \n1.2 to  21). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 10\n9/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of  ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a \ndecrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Sixteen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 days (range: 2  to 664). \nFebrile neutropenia was reported in 1.1% of pat ients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fi fty-one percent had \nGrade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with E NHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment \nwithin 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40- 45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume \ntreatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU \nhas not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to \ninitiation of treatment.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \nLVE F decrease was reported in 3.6% of patients, of which 0.4% were Grade 3. \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patien ts of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of\n8 \n ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by on e level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in 984 \npatients in Study DS8201-A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY- Breast01, DESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -\nBreast04, and DESTINY -Lung02. Among these patients 65% were ex posed for >6 months and 39% were \nexposed for >1 year. In this pooled safety population, the most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including \nlaboratory abnormalities, were nausea (76%), decreased white blood cell count (71%), decreased hemoglobin \n(66%), decreased neutrophil count (65%), decreased lymphocyte count (55%), fatigue (54%), decreased \nplatelet count (47%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (48%), vomiting (44%), increased alanine \naminotransferase (42%), alopecia (39%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (39%), constipation (34%), \nmusculoskeletal pain (32%), decreased appetite (32%), hypokalemia (28%), diarrhea (28%), and respiratory \ninfection (24%).  \n \nHER2 -Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nDESTINY-Breast03 \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 257 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast \ncancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every three weeks in \nDESTINY -Breast03. The median duration of treatment was 14 months (range: 0.7 to 30). \n Serious adverse reactions occurred in 19% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were vomiting, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, pyrexia, and \nurinary tract infection. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients including COVID-19 and sudden death (one patient each). \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 14% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis accounted for 8%. \nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, pneumonia, nausea, fatigue, and ILD/pneumonitis. Dose reductions occurred in 21% of \npatients treated  with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction \nwere nausea, neutropenia, and fatigue. \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (76%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (70%), increased aspartate \naminotransferase (67%), decreased hemoglobin (64%), decreased lymphocyte count (55%), increased alanine aminotransferase (53%), decreased platelet count (52%), fatigue (49%), vomiting (49%), in creased blood \nalkaline phosphatase (49%), alopecia (37%), hypokalemia (35%), constipation (34%), musculoskeletal pain (31%), diarrhea (29%), decreased appetite (29%), respiratory infection (22%), headache (22%), abdominal pain \n(21%), increased blood bilirubin (20%), and stomatitis (20%). \n \nHER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nDESTINY-Breast04  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 371 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ \nor IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in\n9 \n DESTINY -Breast04. The median duration of treatment was 8 months (range: 0.2 to  33) for patients who \nreceived ENHERTU.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 28% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were ILD/pneumonitis, pneumonia, dyspnea, musculoskeletal \npain, sepsis, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypercalcemia, nausea, pyrexia, and vomiting. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4% of patients including ILD/pneumonitis (3 patients); sepsis (2 patients); and \nischemic colitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, dyspnea, febrile neutropenia, general physical \nhealth deterioration, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure (1 patient each).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 16% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis accounted for 8%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 39% of pat ients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, fatigue, anemia, leukopenia, COVID-19, ILD/pneumonitis, increased transaminases, and hyperbilirubinemia. Dose reductions \noccurred in 2 3% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia.  \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nause a (76%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (70%), decreased hemoglobin (64%), decreased neutrophil count (64%), \ndecreased lymphocyte count (55%), fatigue (54%), decreased platelet count (44%), alopecia (40%), vomiting \n(40%), increased aspartate aminotransfe rase (38%), increased alanine aminotransferase (36%), constipation \n(34%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (34%), decreased appetite (32%), musculoskeletal pain (32%), diarrhea (27%), and hypokalemia (25%).  \nUnresectable or Metastatic HER2 -Mutant NSCLC  (5.4 mg/kg) \nDESTINY -Lung02 evaluated two dose levels (5.4 mg/kg [n=101] and 6.4 mg/kg [n=50]); however, only the \nresults for the recommended dose of 5.4  mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks are described below due to \nincreased toxicity observed with the higher dose in patients with NSCLC, including ILD/pneumonitis. \n \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 101 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -mutant \nNSCLC who received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every three weeks in DESTINY-Lung02. \nNineteen percent of patients were exposed for >6 months.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were ILD/pneumonitis, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, nausea, \npleural effusion, and increased troponin I. Fatality occurred in 1 patient with suspected ILD/pneumonitis \n(1%).  \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 8% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent \ndiscontinuation of ENHERTU were ILD/pneumonitis, diarrhea, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, \nmyocarditis, and vomiting. Dose interruptions of ENHERTU due to adverse reactions occurred in 23% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose interruption (>2%) included neutropenia and \nILD/pneumonitis. D ose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 11% of patients.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (61%), decreased white blood cell count (60%), decreased hemoglobin (58%), decreased neutrophi l count (52%), \ndecreased lymphocyte count (43%), decreased platelet count (40%), decreased albumin (39%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (35%), increased alanine aminotransferase (34%), fatigue (32%), constipation \n(31%), decreased appetite (30%), vomiting (26%), increased alkaline phosphatase (22%), and alopecia \n(21%).\n10 \n Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive \ngastric or GEJ ade nocarcinoma in DESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly or \npaclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of tre atment was 4.6  months (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) for patients who received ENHERTU. \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD , anemia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in  \n2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred in one patient each (0.8%).  \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENH ERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased hem oglobin \n(75%), decreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (72%), decreased lymphocyte count \n(70%), decreased platelet count (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), increased aspartate \naminotransferase (58%), fatigue (55%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (54%), increased alanine \naminotransferase (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), increased \nblood bilirubin (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%). \n Use in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use \neffective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with fema le partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of EN HERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 883 patients with breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 \nyears and 3.6% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observe d \nbetween patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade \n3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (60%) as compared to younger patients (48%). \nOf the 101 patients with unresectable or metastat ic HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU \n5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65  years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU \n6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences \nin efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compa red to younger patients.\n11 \n • Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisome rase inhibitor. The recommended dosage of    \nENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times \nULN and any AST).  \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n  Please see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovat ive global healthcare  company contributing to  the sustainable development of \nsociety  that discovers,  develops and delivers new standards of care to  enrich  the quality  of life around the \nworld.

TROPION- Breast05  is \nevaluating datopotamab deruxtecan alone and in combination with durvalumab in patients with locally recurrent inope rable or metastatic TNBC  whose tumors express PD -L1 (CPS ≥ 10) .  \n \nApproximately 300,000 people worldwide are diagnosed annually with TNBC , accounting for \napproximately 15% of all breast cancer diagnoses .\n1,2 TNBC is characterized by its aggressive nature and \nhigh likelihood of recurrence  and progression regardless of st age.3 Standard treatment for patients with \nearly -stage  disease (stage II- III) is typically chemotherapy alone or in combination with immunotherapy \nprior to tumor resection.6 For patients  with metastatic disease, standard first -line treatment can include \nchemotherapy  alone or in combination with immunotherapy.2,3,4  \n In addition to patients with TNBC, T ROPION- Breast04 will enroll patients with HR  low, HER2  low or \nnegative breast cancer  whose tumors express low levels of hormone receptors  (estrogen and/or progesterone  \nreceptor levels  1% to < 10%) . Patients with HR  low, HER2 low or negative disease  have historically  been \nexcluded from TNBC research as their tumors are not triple negative . However,  these patients tend to have\n2 \n worse outcomes r elative to those with hormone receptor -strongly positive tumors (estrogen and/or \nprogesterone receptor levels ≥ 10%)  on standard endocrine therapies .5    \n \n“While t he addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors to chemotherapy has led to survival improvements for \npatients with triple negative breast cancer, the overall prognosis for these patients remains poor,”  said Mark \nRutstein, MD, Global Head, Oncology Clini cal Development, Daiichi Sankyo . “These two phase 3 trials \nwill evaluate whether combining datopotamab deruxtecan, a TROP2 directed antibody drug conjugate, with \ndurvalumab may offer a more effective option for patients across different settings  of breast cancer.” \n \n“In an early  phase  trial, the datopotamab deruxtecan and durvalumab combination has shown robust and \ndurable tumor response s and a manageable safety profile in patients with previously untreated advanced  \ntriple negative breast cancer,” said Cristian Massacesi,  Chief Medical Officer and Oncology Chief \nDevelopment Officer, AstraZeneca . “The i nitiation of the TROPION- Breast04 and TROPION- Breast05 \nphase 3 trials underscore s our confidence in this promising combination and our commitment to researching \nits potential across multiple  settings of triple negative breast cancer and in HR low  disease .”  \n Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca have two additional ongoing phase 3 trials evaluating datopotamab \nderuxtecan in TNBC. TROPION- Breast02  is evaluating datopotamab deruxtecan versus chemotherapy in \npatients with previously untreated locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC who are not candidates \nfor anti -PD-1/PD -L1 therapy. TROPION- Breast03\n is evaluating datopotamab deruxt ecan with and without \ndurvalumab versus investigator’s choice of therapy in patients with stage I to III TNBC with residual \ndisease after neoadjuvant therapy.  \n \nAbout TROPION- Breast04  \nTROPION- Breast04 is a global, randomized, open- label, double -arm, phase 3  trial evaluating the efficacy \nand safety of neoadjuvant datopotamab deruxtecan plus durvalumab followed by adjuvant durvalumab with \nor without chemotherapy compared to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy followed by adjuvant \npembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated stage II or III TNBC or \nHR low, HER2  low or negative breast cancer.  \n \nThe primary endpoint s of TROPION- Breast04  are pathological complete response and event -free survival. \nThe key secondary endpoint is overall survival (OS)  and additional secondary endpoints include distant \ndisease -free survival , pharmacokinetics , immunogenicity , safety  and tolerability .\n3 \n TROPION- Breast04 will enroll approximately 1,700 patients with previously untreated TNBC or HR  low, \nHER2  low or negative breast cancer at study sites in Asia,  Europe, North America, Oceania  and South \nAmerica. For more information , visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout TROPION -Breast0 5 \nTROPION- Breast05 is a global, randomized, open- label, three -arm phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and \nsafety of datopotamab deruxtecan alone and in combination with durvalumab versus investigator’s choice of \nchemotherapy plus pembrolizumab in participa nts with locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC  \nwhose  tumors express  PD-L1 (CPS ≥ 10) . Patients must have completed treatment for s tage I to III breast \ncancer, if indicated, and ≥ 6 months have elapsed between completion of treatment with curative  intent and \nthe first documented recurrence.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of TROPION- Breast0 5 is progression- free survival  (PFS)  as assessed by blinded \nindependent central review . The key secondary endpoint is  OS and additional  secondary endpoints include \nPFS as assessed by investigator , objective response rate, duration of response, pharmacokinetics , \nimmunogenicity, safety  and tolerability .  \n \nTROPION- Breast05 will enroll 625 patients with TNBC at study sites across Asia, Europe, North America  \nand Oceania.  For more information, visit ClinicalTrials.gov .  \n \nAbout Triple Negative Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer in the world and leading cause of cancer -related death.1 More than \ntwo million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2020 with nearly 685,000 deaths globally.1 \n \nWhile some breast cancers test positively  for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors or an \noverexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), TNBC  tests negative for all three .2 \nApproximately 15% of breast cancer tumors  or 300,000 cases annually are considered triple negative.1,2 \nStandard treatment for patients with early stage disease (stage II- III) is typi cally chemotherapy alone or in \ncombination with immunotherapy prior to tumor resection.6 For patients with metastatic disease, standard \nfirst-line treatment can include chemotherapy alone or in combination with immunotherapy.2,3,4 The median \nOS of patients living with metastatic TNBC is 12 to 18 months, with only about 12% of patients living five \nyears following diagnosis.7,8  \n \nTNBC is characterized by its aggressive nature and high likelihood of progression and recurrence  regardless \nof stage .4 There is a great need for innovative therapeutic options across disease stages and treatment \nsettings.\n4 \n  \nTROP2 is a protein broadly expressed in several solid tumors, including TNBC.9 TROP2 i s associated with \nincreased tumor progression and poor survival in patients with breast cancer.10 \n About Hormone Receptor  Low, HER2  Low or  Negative Breast Cancer  \nHR low, HER2  low or negative breast cancer s test positively for  hormone receptors  but at low levels  \n(estrogen and/or progesterone receptor levels 1% to < 10% ) and low or negatively for\n HER2 \n(immunohistochemistry [IHC] scores of 0 or 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -).11,12 HR low breast cancer  occurs in \napproximately 2 to 3% of patients with HR  positive disease  and continues to represent a clinical challenge \nas limited data are available regarding optimal treatment for these patients.11  \n HR expression is a key prognostic and predictive biomarker in breast cancer. While HR positive tumors \n(estrogen and/or progesterone receptor levels  1% to ≥ 10%) are likely to  derive clinical benefit from \nstandard endocrine therapies , HR  low tumors do not.\n11 Patients with HR  low tumors have also historically \nbeen excluded from TNBC research given their tumors are not triple  negative . However, early research \nsuggests HR low tumors may be more similar to TNBC than HR positive tumors,  supporting the inclusion \nof these patients in TNBC clinical trials.11 \n \nAbout  the Daiichi Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi \nSankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and \nsupply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nAbout Datopotamab Deruxtecan (Dato- DXd)  \nDatopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) is an investigational TROP2 directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi \nSankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, datopotamab deruxtecan is one of six ADCs in the oncology \npipeline of Daiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanced programs in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. Datopotamab deruxtecan is comprised of a humanized anti -TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, \ndeveloped in collaboration with Sapporo Medical University, attached to a number of topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads  (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide- based cleavable linkers.  \n \nA comprehensive development program called TROPION is underway globally with more than 14 trials \nevaluating the efficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan across multiple tumors,  including non- small \ncell lung cancer, TNBC , HR low,  HER2 low or negative breast cancer and HR positive,  HER2  low or\n5 \n negative breast cancer. Beyond the TROPION program, datopotamab deruxtecan also is being evaluated in \nnovel combinations in several ongoing trials.  \n \nAbout the DXd ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo \nThe DXd ADC portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo currently consists of six ADCs in clinical development across \nmultiple types of cancer.

These results, which include  the \nfirst progression -free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) findings reported from the trial , will be \npresented today as a late -breaking mini -oral session  (LBA34 ) at the European Society f or Medical Oncology \n(#ESMO 23) 2023 Congress and simultaneously published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology . \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2  directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly \ndeveloped and commerciali zed by Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and AstraZeneca ( LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN ).  \n In the primary analysis, ENHERTU continued to show a confirmed objective response rate (ORR) of  37.1% \n(95% confidence interval [CI]: 31.3-43.2), as assess ed by investigator,  in the overall population of previously \ntreated patients (n=267) with HER2 expressing advanced solid tumors, including either  biliary tract, bladder, \ncervical, endometrial, ovarian, pancreatic or other tumor s. A median duration of response (DO R) of  11.3 \nmonths ( 95% CI : 9.6-17.8) was seen with  a median PFS of 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.6 -8.0) and median OS of \n13.4 months (95% CI:\n 11.9-15.5). Median follow-up was 12.75 months as of the data cut-off of June 8, 2023.  \n The highest response rates continued to be seen in the exploratory analysis of patients with tumor HER2 \nexpression of  immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ (n=75) as confirmed by central testing , where ENHERTU \ndemonstrated a confirmed ORR of 61.3% (95% CI: 49.4-72.4). A m edian DO R of 22.1 months  (95% CI: 9.6-\nNR) was achieved in this population of patients with HER2 IHC 3+ expression, with ENHERTU \ndemonstrating a median PFS of 11.9 months (95% CI: 8.2-13.0) and a median OS of 21.1 months (95% CI:\n \n15.3-29.6). These clinically meaningful outcomes affirm  the interim DESTINY -PanTumor02 results  \npresented  earlier this year at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual M eeting .\n2 \n  \n“These primary analysis results con firm the efficacy shown at an  interim analysis of the DESTINY -\nPanTumor02 trial, with responses leading to clinically meaningful survival outcomes across a broad range of \nHER2 expressing solid tumors,” said Funda Meric -Bernstam, MD, Chair of Investigational Cancer \nTherapeutics at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center  and Principal Investigator for the trial . \n“Based on these results, ENHERTU has the potential to change the course of disease for certain patients with \nHER2 expressing advanced cancers who have limited treatment options and currently no approved HER2 directed therapies.”  \n The safety profile observe d in DESTINY -PanTumor02 was consistent with previous clinical trials of \nENHERTU with no new safety concerns identified. Grade 3 or higher treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 40.8% of patients . The most common grade 3 or higher TEAEs  occur ring in ≥5% of \npatients were neutropenia  (19.1%) , anemia ( 10.9%), fatigue (7. 1%) and thrombocytopenia (5.6 %). In \nDESTINY -PanTumor02, 10 .5% of patients  (n=28)  experienced interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis \nof any grade related to treatment with ENHERTU as determined by an independent adjudication committee. \nThe majority of ILD or pneumonitis events were low grade (grade 1  [n=7; 2.6%]  or grade 2 [n=1 7; 6.4%] ) \nwith one grade 3  (0.4%), zero grade 4 (0%) and three  grade 5 (1.1%) event s observed.  \n “Improving survival outcomes for patients is one of the  primary goals of cancer treatment  and the clinically \nmeaningful progression- free and overall survival results seen in DESTINY -PanTumor02 are encouraging,” \nsaid Mark Rutstein , MD, Global Head, Oncology Clinical Development , Daiichi Sankyo. “ These results  \nprovide additional evidence for  ENHERTU  to potentially becom e the first antibody drug conjugate approved \nin a tumor agnostic setting in patients whose tumors express HER2 .”  \n “These updated data from DESTINY -PanTumor02 continue to illustrate  the importance of HER2 as an \nactionable biomarker across a range of studied solid tumor  types,”  said Cristian Massacesi, MD, Chief \nMedical Officer and Oncology Chief Development Officer, AstraZeneca. “ ENHERTU has the potential to \noffer improved outcomes for specific patients with  previously treated HER2  expressing cancers and we hope  \nto bring this important medicine to patients as quickly as possible .”  \n  \nIn DESTINY -PanTumor 02, 40.8% of patients (n=109) had r eceived three or more prior lines of therapy . As \nof the data cut -off of  June  8, 2023, a total of 267 patients had received treatment  and of those 75 (28.1%) \nwere  IHC 3+ as determined by central testing.\n3 \n Summary of DESTINY -PanTumor02 Primary Analysis Results  \n \nEfficacy \nMeasure All \nPatients  Endometrial  Cervical  Ovarian  Bladder  BTC  Pancreatic  Otheri \nAll IHC Expression Levels  \n(n) 267 40 40 40 41 41 25 40 \nConfirmed \nORR (%)  \n(Investigator \nAssessed)  \n(95% CI)ii 37.1%  \n(31.3-43.2)  57.5% \n(40.9-73.0)  50.0%  \n(33.8-66.2)  45.0%  \n(29.3-61.5)  39.0%  \n(24.2-55.5)  22.0%  \n(10.6-37.6)  4.0%  \n(0.1- 20.4)  30.0%  \n(16.6-46.5)  \nMedian D OR \n(months)  \n(95% CI)iii 11.3 \n(9.6- 17.8) NR \n(9.9-NR) 14.2 \n(4.1-NR)  11.3 \n(4.1- 22.1)  8.7 \n(4.3- 11.8)  8.6 \n(2.1-NR)  5.7  \n(NR-NR)  22.1 \n(4.1-NR)  \nMedian PFS \n(months) \n(95% CI) 6.9  \n(5.6- 8.0) 11.1 \n(7.1-NR)  7.0 \n(4.2- 11.1)  5.9 \n(4.0- 8.3) 7.0 \n(4.2- 9.7) 4.6  \n(3.1- 6.0) 3.2 \n(1.8- 7.2) 8.8 \n(5.5- 12.5)  \nMedian OS  \n(months) \n(95% CI) 13.4  \n(11.9-15.5)  26.0 \n(12.8-NR)  13.6 \n(11.1-NR)  13.2 \n(8.0- 17.7)  12.8 \n(11.2-15.1)  7.0  \n(4.6- 10.2)  5.0  \n(3.8- 14.2)  21.0 \n(12.9-24.3)  \nIHC 3+  \n(n) 75 13 8 11 16 16 2 9 \nConfirmed \nORR (%)  \n(95% CI)ii 61.3%  \n(49.4-72.4)  84.6%  \n(54.6-98.1)  75.0%  \n(34.9-96.8)  63.6%  \n(30.8-89.1)  56.3%  \n(29.9-80.2)  56.3%  \n(29.9-80.2)  0.0%  44.4%  \n(13.7-78.8)  \nMedian D OR \n(months) \n(95% CI)iii 22.1  \n(9.6-NR)        \nMedian PFS  \n(months) \n(95% CI) 11.9  \n(8.2- 13.0)  NR  \n(7.3-NR)  NR \n(3.9-NR)  12.5  \n(3.1-NR)  7.4  \n(3.0- 11.9)  7.4  \n(2.8- 12.5)  5.4  \n(2.8-NR)  23.4  \n(5.6-NR)  \nMedian OS  \n(months) \n(95% CI) 21.1  \n(15.3-29.6)  26.0  \n(18.9-NR)  NR  \n(3.9-NR)  20.0 \n(3.8-NR)  13.4 \n(6.7- 19.8)  12.4 \n(2.8-NR)  12.4  \n(8.8-NR)  24.3 \n(11.1-NR)  \nIHC 2+  \n(n) 125 17 20 19 20 14 19 16 \nConfirmed \nORR (%)  \n(95% CI)ii 27.2%  \n(19.6-35.9)  47.1%  40.0%  36.8%  35.0%  0.0%  5.3%  18.8%  \nMedian D OR \n(months) \n(95% CI)iii 9.8  \n(4.3- 12.6)         \nMedian PFS \n(months) \n(95% CI) 5.4  \n(4.2- 6.0) 8.5  \n(4.6- 15.1)  4.8  \n(2.7- 5.7) 4.1  \n(2.3- 12.6)  7.8  \n(2.6- 11.6)  4.2  \n(2.8- 6.0) 2.8  \n(1.4- 9.1) 5.5  \n(2.8- 8.7) \nMedian OS \n(months) \n(95% CI) 12.2  \n(10.7-13.5)  16.4 \n(8.0-NR)  11.5 \n(5.1-NR)  13.0 \n(4.7- 21.9)  13.1 \n(11.0-19.9)  6.0 \n(3.7- 11.7)  4.9 \n(2.4- 15.7)  14.6 \n(6.8- 22.4)  \nBTC, biliary tract cancer; CI, confidence interval; DO R, duration of response; IHC, immunohistochemistry; NR, not reached; ORR , objective \nresponse rat e; OS, overall survival ; PFS, progression -free survival  \niResponses in extramammary Paget disease, head and neck cancer, oropharyngeal neoplasm, and salivary gland cancer.  \niiAnalysis of ORR by investigator was performed in patients who received ≥1 dose of ENHERTU; all patients (n=267; including 67 patients with IHC \n1+ [n=25], IHC 0 [n=30], or unknown IHC status [n=12] by central testing) and patients with centrally confirmed HER2 IHC 3+ (n=75) or IHC 2+ \n(n=125) status.\n4 \n iiiAnalysis of D OR was performed in patients with objective response who received ≥1 dose of ENHERTU; all patients (n=99; including 19 patients \nwith IHC 1+ [n=6], IHC 0 [n=9], or unknown IHC status [n=4] by central testing) and patients with centrally confirmed HER2 IHC 3+ (n=46) or IHC \n2+ (n=34) status.  \n \nAbout D ESTINY-PanTumor02  \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 is a global, multicenter, multi -cohort, open- label phase 2 trial evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) for the treatment of previously treated HER2 expressing tumors, including biliary tract, bladder, cervical, endome trial, ovarian, pancreatic cancer or  other tumors.  \nThe primary efficacy endpoint of DESTINY-PanTumor02 is confirmed ORR as assessed by investigator. Secondary endpoints include DO R, disease control rate ( DCR ), PFS, OS, safety, tolerability and \npharmacokin etics. DESTINY -PanTumor02 has enrolled 267 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and \nNorth America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n About HER2 Expression in Solid Tumors  \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor  growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface  of various tissue cells \nthroughout the body and is involved in normal cell growth.1,2 In some cancer s, HER2  expression is  amplified \nor the cells  have activating mutations .1,3 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a result of HER2  gene \namplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis.4 \n \nWhile HER2 directed therapies have been used to treat breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers, more \nresearch is needed evaluating their potential role in treating other HER2 expressing solid  tumor types .2,5,6 \n \nHER2 is an emerging biomarker in solid tumor types including  biliary tract, bladder, cervical, endometrial, \novarian and pancreatic cancers.3 Testing is not routinely performed in these additional tumor types and as a \nresult, available literature is limited. HER2 overexpression (IHC 3+) has been observed at rates from 1% to \n28% in these solid tumors .7,8  \n \nThere is an unmet need for effective therapies for certain HER2 expressing solid tumors, particularly for \nthose who have progressed on or are refractory to  standard of care therapies as t here are currently no \napproved HER2 directed therapies for these cancers.2,9  \n About ENHERTU  ENHERTU  (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU  is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU  consists of a HER2 m onoclonal antibody attached to a  number of  topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payloads ( an exatecan derivative,  DXd)  via tetrapeptide- based cleavable linkers.\n5 \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 55 countries  worldwide  for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior  anti-\nHER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have  \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy based on the results from  \nthe DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approve d in more than 40 countries  worldwide  for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ in-situ hybridization (ISH) -) breast cancer \nwho have received a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during \nor within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -\nBreast04  trial. \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries worldwide  for the treatment of adult patients  \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2  (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who have re ceived a prior systemic therapy based on the results \nfrom the  DESTINY -Lung02 trial. Continued approval in the U.S. for this indication may be contingent upon \nverification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.   \n ENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries  worldwide  for the treatment of adult pat ients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the \nDESTINY -Gastric01  and/or DESTINY -Gastric02  trials.  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global  clinical  development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers. Trials in combination with other \nanticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU  in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the \nmanufacturing and supply of ENHERTU  and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nAbout  the DXd  ADC Portfolio of  Daiichi  Sankyo  \n \nThe DXd  ADC  portfolio of  Daiichi  Sankyo currently  consists  of six ADCs  in clinical  development  across  \nmultiple  types  of cancer.  ENHERTU,  a HER2  directed  ADC,  and datopotamab deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd),  a\n6 \n TROP2  directed  ADC,  are being jointly  developed and comme rcialized  globally with  AstraZeneca.  \nPatritumab  deruxtecan  (HER3 -DXd),  a HER3  directed  ADC,  ifinatamab  deruxtecan  (I-DXd),  a B7 -H3 \ndirected  ADC,  and raludotatug deruxtecan  (R-DXd),  a CDH6  directed  ADC,  are being  jointly  developed and \ncommercialized  globally with  Merck  & Co.,  Inc., Rahway,  N.J. USA.  DS-3939, a TA -MUC1  directed  ADC,  \nis being developed by Daiichi  Sankyo.  \n \nDesigned  using Daiichi  Sankyo’s proprietary  DXd  ADC  technology to  target  and deliver a cytotoxic  payload \ninside cancer  cells  that express a specific cell surface antigen, each  ADC  consists of a monoclonal antibody \nattached  to a number of  topoisomerase  I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan  derivative,  DXd)  via tetrapeptide -\nbased  cleavable linkers. \n Datopotamab  deruxtecan,  ifinatamab  deruxtecan,  patritumab  deruxtecan, raludotatug deruxtecan  and DS -\n3939 are  investigational medicines  that have  not been  approved for  any indication  in any country. Safety  and \nefficacy  have not  been  established.\n \n \nENHERTU U.S. Important Safety Information  \n \nIndications  \n \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based \nregimen either:  \n– In the metastatic setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six \nmonths of completing therapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH- ) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -\napproved test, who have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease \nrecurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 \n(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test, and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen\n7 \n  \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY  \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \nWarnings and Precautions \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resol ved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomat ic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, ILD \noccurred in 12% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 1.0% of patients treated \nwith ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 5  months (range: 0.9 to 23). \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8  months (range: \n1.2 to  21). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with E NHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, th en maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 10\n9/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a \ndecrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Sixteen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased \nneutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 days (range: 2  to 664). \nFebrile neutropenia was reported in 1.1% of patients.\n8 \n  \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty- one pe rcent had \nGrade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients. \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may  be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during t reatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40- 45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, perm anently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume \ntreatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is \n>20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of  <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU \nhas not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to \ninitiation of treatment.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \nLVEF decrease was reported in 3.6% of patients, of which 0.4% were Grade 3.  \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinica l adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n Embryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in 984 \npatients in Study DS8201-A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY- Breast01, DESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -\nBreast04, and DESTINY -Lung02.

Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were vomiting, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, pyrexia, and \nurinary tract infection. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients including COVID-19 \nand sudden death (one patient each). \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 14% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis accounted for 8%. \nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, pneumonia, nausea, fatigue, and ILD/pneumonitis. Dose reductions occurred in 21% of \npatients treated  with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction \nwere nausea, neutropenia, and fatigue. \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (76%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (70%), increased aspartate \naminotransferase (67%), decreased hemoglobin (64%), decreased lymphocyte count (55%), increased alanine \naminotransferase (53%), decreased platelet count (52%), fatigue (49%), vomiting (49%), in creased blood \nalkaline phosphatase (49%), alopecia (37%), hypokalemia (35%), constipation (34%), musculoskeletal pain \n(31%), diarrhea (29%), decreased appetite (29%), respiratory infection (22%), headache (22%), abdominal pain \n(21%), increased blood bilirubin (20%), and stomatitis (20%). \n \nHER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nDESTINY-Breast04  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 371 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ \nor IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \nDESTINY -Breast04. The median duration of treatment was 8 months (range: 0.2 to  33) for patients who \nreceived ENHERTU.  \n Serious adverse reactions occurred in 28% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were ILD/pneumonitis, pneumonia, dyspnea, musculoskeletal \npain, sepsis, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypercalcemia, nausea, pyrexia, and vomiting. Fatalities due to \nadverse reactions occurred in 4% of patients including ILD/pneumoni tis (3  patients); sepsis (2  patients); and \nischemic colitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, dyspnea, febrile neutropenia, general physical \nhealth deterioration, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure (1 patient each).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 16% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis accounted for 8%. \nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 39% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, fatigue, anemia, \nleukopenia, COVID-19, ILD/pneumonitis, increased transaminases, and hyperbilirubinemia. Dose reductions \noccurred in 23% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose re duction were fatigue, nausea, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (76%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (70%), decreased hemoglobin (64%), decreased neutrophil count (64%), \ndecreased lymphocyte count (55%), fatigue (54%), decreased platelet count (44%), alopecia (40%), vomiting\n10 \n (40%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (38%), increased alanine aminotransferase (36%), constipation \n(34%), increased blood alkaline pho sphatase (34%), decreased appetite (32%), musculoskeletal pain (32%), \ndiarrhea (27%), and hypokalemia (25%).  \nUnresectable or Metastatic HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) \nDESTINY -Lung02 evaluated two dose levels (5.4 mg/kg [n=101] and 6.4 mg/kg [n=50]); however, only the \nresults for the recommended dose of 5.4  mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks are described below due to \nincreased toxicity observed with the higher dose in patients with NSCLC, including ILD/pneumonitis. \n \nThe safety of ENHERTU was e valuated in 101 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -mutant \nNSCLC who received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every three weeks in DESTINY-Lung02. \nNineteen percent of patients were exposed for >6 months.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were ILD/pneumonitis, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, nausea, \npleural effusion, and increased troponin I. Fatality occurred in 1 patient with suspected ILD/pneumon itis \n(1%).  \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 8% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent \ndiscontinuation of ENHERTU were ILD/pneumonitis, diarrhea, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, \nmyocarditis, and vomiting. Dose interruptions of ENHERTU due to adverse reactions occurred in 23% of \npatients. Adverse reactions which required dose interruption (>2%) included neutropenia and \nILD/pneumonitis. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 11% of patients.  \nThe most common (≥20%) adve rse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (61%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (60%), decreased hemoglobin (58%), decreased neutrophil count (52%), decreased lymphocyte count (43%), decreased platelet count (40%), decreased albumin (39%), increased \naspartate aminotransferase (35%), increased alanine aminotransferase (34%), fatigue (32%), constipation \n(31%), decreased appetite (30%), vomiting (26%), increased alkaline phosphatase (22%), and alopecia \n(21%).   \n \nLocally Advanced or Metas tatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in DESTINY- Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU ( N=125) 6.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly or \npaclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) for patients who received ENHERTU. \n Serious adverse reaction s occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, pneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage.

Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decrea sed appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased hemoglobin \n(75%), decreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (72%), decreased lymphocyte count \n(70%), decreased platelet count (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), increased aspartate\n11 \n aminotransferase (58%), fatigue (55%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (54%), increased alanine \naminotransferase (47%), diarrhea (32%), hyp okalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), increased \nblood bilirubin (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \nUse in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with fema le partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 883 patients with breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 \nyears and 3.6% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy withi n clinical studies were observed \nbetween patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade \n3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (60%) as compared to younger patients (48%). \nOf the 101 patient s with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU \n5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65  years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU \n6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences \nin efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The  \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxi cities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor. The recommended dosage of    \nENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST). \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi San kyo, Inc. at 1- 877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n  \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare  company contributing to  the sustainable development of \nsociety  that discovers,  develops and delivers new standards of care to  enrich  the quality  of life around the \nworld.

These data, the first of two positive late -breaking \npresentation s (LBA11 ) from the datopotamab deruxtecan clinical development program, were featured \nduring Presidential Symposium 3 at the Eu ropean Society for Medical Oncology (#ESMO23) 2023 \nCongress.  \n \nDatopotamab deruxtecan is a specifically engineered TROP2 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) \nbeing jointly developed by Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN).  \n \nIn the dual primary endpoint analysis, datopotamab deruxtecan reduced the risk of disease progression or \ndeath by 37% compared to investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR]=0.63; 95% confidence \ninterval [CI]: 0.52 -0.76; p<0.0001) in patients with HR positive, HER2 low or negative metastatic breast \ncancer as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Median PFS was 6.9 months in patients \ntreated with datopotamab deruxtecan compared to 4.9 months in those trea ted with chemotherapy. A \nconsistent benefit in PFS was observed across subgroups. Results also showed a confirmed objective \nresponse rate (ORR) of 36.4% in patients treated with datopotamab deruxtecan compared to an ORR of \n22.9% in patients treated with ch emotherapy.   \n \nFor the dual primary endpoint of overall survival (OS), interim results numerically favored datopotamab \nderuxtecan over chemotherapy (HR=0.84; 95% CI: 0.62 -1.14), however, results did not reach statistical \nsignificance at the time of this da ta cut -off. The trial is ongoing to assess OS.\n2  \n“Despite the initial benefit of endocrine therapy, most patients with HR positive, HER2 low or negative \nmetastatic breast cancer will eventually experience disease progression and require additional treatment  with \nchemotherapy ,” said Aditya Bardia, MD, MPH, Director of Breast Cancer Research, Mass General Cancer \nCenter, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and investigator in the trial. “In the \nTROPION -Breast01 trial, datopotamab deruxteca n reduced patients’ risk of disease progression or death by \nmore than a third and overall had fewer treatment -related serious adverse events than standard chemotherapy , \nillustrating its potential to become a new standard of care in a treatment setting wher e there is a clinical \nunmet need .”  \n \nDatopotamab deruxtecan demonstrated a favorable safety profile over chemotherapy with no new safety \nconcerns identified. Grade 3 or higher treatment -related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 21% and 45% \nof patients in the datopotamab deruxtecan and chemot herapy arms, respectively. The most common grade 3 \nor higher TRAEs were neutropenia (1% vs. 31%), stomatitis (6% vs. 3%), fatigue (2% vs. 2%) and anemia \n(1% vs. 2%). In the datopotamab deruxtecan arm, the all -grade interstitial lung disease (ILD) rate was low \n(3%) and the majority of events were low grade. There was one grade 5 ILD event adjudicated as drug -\nrelated by an independent committee.  The primary cause of death in this case was a ttributed to disease \nprogression by the treating investigator.   \n \n“The se statistically significant and clinically meaningful results from the TROPION -Breast01 trial support \ndatopotamab deruxtecan as a new potential standard of care for patients with advanced HR positive, HER2 \nlow or negative breast cancer in the post -endocri ne therapy setting,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, \nR&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “The results further validate the portability of Daiichi Sankyo's DXd antibody drug \nconjugate  technology to additional targets such as TROP2, and we look forward to potentially bringing our \nsecond antibody drug conjugate to patients with breast cancer.”  \n \n“With these TROPION -Breast01 results, datopotamab deruxtecan has the potential to meaningfully improve \ntreatment expectations for patients with HR positive, HER2 low or negative  metastatic breast cancer by \noffering  an effective and better tolerated treatment option after endocrine therapy and only one line of \nchemotherapy,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, \nAstraZeneca. “We look forward t o continuing discussions with regulatory authorities with the goal of \nbringing  this TROP2 directed antibody drug conjugate to eligible patients as soon as possible.”  \n \nAfter endocrine therapy, the most common prior treatments for patients in the datopotamab deruxtecan and \nchemotherapy arms, respectively, included one (63% vs. 61%) to two (37% vs. 38%) lines of chemotherapy \nand CDK4/6 inhibitors (82% vs. 78%). At the July  17, 2023 data cut -off, 93 patients remained on treatment \nwith datopotamab deruxtecan and 39 remained on chemotherapy.\n3  \nSummary of TROPION -Breast01 Efficacy Results  \nCI, confidence interval; CR, complete response; OS, overall survival; ORR, overall response rate; PFS, progression -free survival; PR, partial response  \ni with median follow -up of 9.7 months, OS data were not mature  \nii as assessed by BICR  \niii ORR is (complete response + partial response)  \n \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca have two phase 3 trials evaluating  datopotamab deruxtecan in triple \nnegative breast cancer (TNBC). TROPION -Breast02  is comparing datopotamab derux tecan to chemotherapy \nin patients with previously untreated locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC who are not candidates \nfor anti -PD-1/PD -L1 therapy. TROPION -Breast03  is evaluating datopotamab deruxtecan with and without \ndurvalumab versus investigator’s choice of therapy in patients with stage 1  to 3 TNBC with residual disease \nafter neoadjuvant therapy.  \n \nAbout TROPION -Breast 01 \nTROPION -Breast01  is a global, randomized, multicenter, open -label phase 3 trial evaluating the safety and \nefficacy of datopotamab der uxtecan versus investigator’s choice of single -agent chemotherapy (eribulin, \ncapecitabine, vinorelbine or gemcitabine) in patients with inoperable or metastatic HR positive, HER2 low or \nnegative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have previou sly progressed on or are not \nsuitable for  endocrine therapy per investigator assessment and have received at least one systemic therapy . \n \nThe dual primary endpoints of TROPION -Breast01 are PFS as assessed by BICR and OS. Key secondary \nendpoints include ORR , duration of response, investigator -assessed PFS, disease control rate and time to first \nsubsequent therapy.  \n \nTROPION -Breast01 enrolled  more than 700  patients at sites in Asia, Europe, North America , South America  \nand Africa .

One (1.0%) complete \nresponse (CR) and 49 (48.0%) partial responses (PR) were observed. The median duration of response \n(DOR) was 16.8 months (95% CI: 6.4- not estimable [NE]).   \n “HER2  mutant non -small cell lung cancer is more c ommonly diagnosed in patients who are younger and \nfemale, and there are limited treatment options, which often results in a poor prognosis,” said  Prof essor  \nMartin Reck, MD, Head of Department of Thoracic Oncology, Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf, Germany. “ENHERTU is the first HER2  directed therapy to demonstrate strong and durable results for these patients, \nand this approval in the EU marks an important step forward in how the disease can be treated.”\n2 “Since our initial approval of ENHERTU for metastatic  breast cancer in the EU  more than two years ago, we \nhave remained committed to bringing this innovative antibody drug conjugate to more  patients with HER2 \ntargetable tumors, especially those that have previously not been eligible  for treatment with a  HER2 directed \ntherap y,” said Ken Keller, Global Head of Oncology Business, and President and CEO, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. \n“With today’s news , ENHERTU is  the first antibody drug conjugate approved for lung cancer in the EU and \nis now appr oved in three different tumor types .” \n \n“Understanding the molecular drivers behind a lung cancer diagnosis is critical, and while there are now targeted options for many patients, those with HER2  mutant non- small cell lung cancer have had few \ntreatment options,  none of which have been approved to treat their specific  type of lung cancer ,” said Dave \nFredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, AstraZeneca. “ENHERTU is the first HER2  \ndirected  option approved for HER2  mutant disease and confirms the relevance of HER2 as a target in lung \ncance r.” \n \nIn DESTINY -Lung02, the safety profile of ENHERTU was  consistent with other trials of ENHERTU with \nno new safety signals observed. Grade 3 or grade 4 treatment -related adverse events from a pooled safety \nanalysis of patients treated with at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg across multiple tumor types in \nclinical studies (n=1,449) included neutropenia (17.0%), anemia (9.5%), fatigue (8.4%), leukopenia (6.4%), \nnausea (5 .9%), thrombocytopenia (5.0%), lymphopenia (4.8%), hypokalemia (3.8%), transaminases \nincreased (3.6%), vomiting (2.7%), diarrhea (2.0%), decreased appetite (1.7%), pneumonia (1.4%) and ejection fraction decreased (1.1%). Grade  5 adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% of patients, including \ninterstitial lung disease  (1.0%) .\n \n \nFinancial Considerations  \nFollowing approval in the EU, an amount of $75 million is due from AstraZeneca to Daiichi Sankyo as a \nmilestone payment in HER2  mutant non -small cell lung cancer . Sales of ENHERTU in most EU territories \nare recognized by Daiichi Sankyo.  For further details on the financial arrangements, please consult the \ncollaboration agreement from March 2019.  \n \nAbout DESTINY- Lung02  \nDESTINY -Lung02 is a global, randomized phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU in \npatients with HER2 mutant unresectable and/or metastatic NSCLC with disease recurrence or progression \nduring or after at least one regimen of prior anticancer therapy that must have contained a platinum -based \nchemotherapy. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg (n=102) or ENHERTU 6.4 \nmg/kg (n=50).\n3 The primary endpoint of the trial is confirmed ORR as assessed by BICR. Secondary endpoints include \ndisease control rate, D OR and progression- free survival assessed by investigator and BICR, overall s urvival \nand safety. DESTINY -Lung02 enrolled 152 patients at multiple sites, including Asia, Europe, Oceania and \nNorth America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout  HER2  Mutant  NSCLC            \nLung cancer is the second most common form of cancer globally with more than two million cases diagnosed \nin 2020.1 In Europe, l ung cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer with more than 477,000 cases \ndiagnosed in 2020.2 Lung cancer is also the l eading cause of cancer -related deaths in Europe, with  nearly  \n400,000 deaths reported in 2020.2 Prognosis is particularly poor for patients with metastatic NSCLC as only \napproximately 9% will live beyond five years after diagnosis.3  \n HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of multiple tumor \ntypes . Certain HER2 ( ERBB2 ) gene alterations (called HER2  mutations) have been identified in patients with \nnon-squamous NSCLC as a distinct molecular target, and occur in approximately 2% to 4% of patients with \nthis type of lung cancer .\n4,5 While HER2  gene mutations can occur in a r ange of patients, they are more \ncommonly found in patients with NSCLC who are younger, female and have never smoked.6 HER2 gene \nmutations have been independently associated with cancer cell growth and poor prognosis, with an increased incidence of brain m etastases .\n7 Next -generation sequencing has been utilized in the identification of HER2  \n(ERBB2 ) mutations.8,9 \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed  \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific  \nplatform. ENHERTU c onsists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a  number of  topoisomerase I \ninhibitor  payloads  (an exatecan derivative,  DXd) via tetrapeptide- based cleavable linkers.  \n ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 55 countries  worldwide  for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior anti -\nHER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have  \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy based on the results from  \nthe DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 40 countries  worldwide  for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ in-situ hybridization (ISH) -) breast cancer \nwho have received a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during\n4 or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -\nBreast04  trial. \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating  HER2  (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Lung02 trial. Continued approval for this indication in the U.S. may be contingent upon \nverification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the \nDESTINY -Gastric01  and/or DESTINY -Gastric02  trials.\n  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program \nA comprehensive global clinical  development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  \n About the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato- DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC.

These results were presented today during a mini oral \nsession (379MO ) at the  European Society for Medical Oncology ( #ESMO 23) 2023 Congress . \n \nDatopotamab deruxtecan is a spec ifically engineered TROP2  directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) \nbeing jointly developed by Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN).  \n \nApproximately 300,000 people worldwide are diagnosed annually with TNBC , the most aggressive breast \ncancer  subtype .1,2 Less than half of patients  with metastatic TNBC respond to current first-line treatment \noptions  which can include chemotherapy  alone or in combination with an immunotherapy .2,3,4 Among \npatients with tumors that respond to initial treatment, disease progression is common and rapid, often \noccurring within two years .2,4,5,6  \n \nResults showed that datopotamab deruxtecan plus durvalumab , an anti P D-L1 therapy,  demonstrated a  \nconfirmed  objective response rate (ORR) of 79%  (95% confidence interval [CI]: 67 -88) including  six \ncomplete responses (CR s) and 43 partial responses (PR s). Responses were observed regardless of PD -L1 \nexpression  level . Median progression -free survival (PFS) was 13.8 months (95% CI: 11 -not calculable \n[NC]) and median duration of response (D oR) was 15.5 months (95% CI: 9.9 -NC) with 11.7 months of \nfollow -up.\n2 \n “These results  for datopot amab deruxtecan plus durvalumab  in the first -line triple negative breast cancer \nsetting  are highly encouraging , particular ly the 79%  objective response rate ,” said Peter Schmid, MD, Barts \nCancer Institute, London, United Kingdom, and investigator in the trial. “ This magnitude  of response is \nespecially notable given the majority of patients in this cohort have PD -L1 low tumors, representing a \npopulation for whom treatment has long been limited to standard chemotherapy .” \n \nThe safety profile of datopotamab deruxtecan in combination with durvalumab was consistent with the \nknown safety profiles of both agents. Grade 3 or higher treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) \noccurred in 57% of patients. The most common  grade 3 or hi gher TEAEs were increased amylase (18% ), \nstomatitis  (11%), constipation (2%), fatigue ( 2%), vomiting (2%) and decreased appetite (2%). There  were \nthree interstitial lung disease (ILD) events adjudicated as drug-related by an independent committee \nincluding two grade 2 events and one grade 1 event.  \n \n“Disease progression after initial treatment is a reality for patients with triple negative breast cancer, \nunderscoring the need for more durable treatment optio ns,” said Mark Rutstein, MD, Global Head, \nOncology Clinical Development, Daiichi Sankyo. “These findings showcase the potential of datopotamab \nderuxtecan in previously untreated advanced triple negative breast cancer  and, following the positive results \nof our TROPION -Breast01 phase 3 trial , build on the growing body of evidence for the potential use of this \nTROP2 directed antibody drug conjugate , alone and in combination s, in several subtypes of breast cancer .”  \n \n“Progress in the  first-line advanced triple negative breast cancer setting  has been modest for years and new \ntherapeutic strategies are needed to improve outcomes for patients with this  aggressive breast cancer  \nsubtype ,” said Cristian Massacesi , Chief Medical Officer and Oncology Chi ef Development Officer, \nAstraZeneca . “These updated results from the BEGONIA trial reinforce  our confidence in the potential for \ndatopotamab deruxtecan to become a  new, important treatment modality  in this setting  as we eagerly await \nresults from our ongoing  phase 3  triple negative breast cancer program .”  \n \nIn Arm 7 of the BEGONIA trial (n=62), the majority of  patients (n=54) had tumors with low PD -L1 \nexpression (tumor area positivity [TAP]<10%). S even patients had  tumors with  high PD -L1 expression \n(TAP≥10%) . As of the February 2, 2023 data cut -off, 29 patients (47%) remained on study treatment . \n \nSummary of BEG ONIA Arm 7 Efficacy Results  \nEfficacy Measure  (as assessed by investigator)  All Patients (n=62 ) \nConfirmed ORRi, % (95% CI)  79% (n=49) (66.8 -88.3)  \n     CR rate, %  10% (n=6)  \n     PR rate, % 69% (n=43)\n3 \n Median DoR (months) (95% CI) 15.5 months (9.9 -not calculable)  \nMedian PFS (months) (95% CI) 13.8 months (11 .0-not calculable)  \nCI, confidence interval; CR, complete response;  DoR, duration of response;  ORR, objective response rate;  PFS, progression -free survival;  PR, partial \nresponse  \ni ORR is (complete response + partial response)  \n \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca have two phase 3 trials  evaluating  datopotamab deruxtecan  in patients with \nTNBC . TROPION -Breast02  is comparing  datopotamab deruxtecan  to chemotherapy  in patients with \npreviously untreated locally recurrent inoper able or metastatic TNBC  who are not candidates for anti -PD-\n1/PD-L1 therapy. TROPION -Breast03  is evaluating datopotamab deruxtecan with and without durvalumab \nversus investigator’s choice of therapy in patients with stage 1 to 3 TNBC with residual disease after \nneoadjuvant therapy.  \n \nSeveral presentations feature d during the ESMO 2023 Congress are showcasing the strength and depth of \ndata for datopotamab deruxtecan across multiple tumor types and settings, including results from the \nTROPION -Lung01 and TROPION -Breast01 phase 3  trials.  \n \nAbout BEGONIA  \nBEGONIA  is an open -label, two -part, multicenter phase 1b/2  trial evaluating durvalumab in combination \nwith oncology therapies with or without paclitaxel for t he first-line treatment of metastatic TNBC. Arm 7 of \nthe trial is evaluating the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of datopotamab deruxtecan  in \ncombination with durvalumab  in patients with previously untreated, unresectable locally advanced or \nmetastatic TNBC.  The primary e ndpoints are safety  and tolerability. Secondary endpoints are investigator -\nassessed ORR , PFS and DoR. \n \nEnrollment is currently underway for Arm 8 of the BEGONIA  trial, which is evaluating datopotamab \nderuxtecan plus  durvalumab in patients with TNBC whose tumors  have high levels of PD-L1 expression . \n \nAbout Triple Negative Breast Cancer   \nBreast cancer is the most common  cancer in the world and leading cause of cancer -related death .1 More than \ntwo million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2020 with nearly 68 5,000 deaths globally .1 \n \nWhile some breast cancers may test positive for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors or \noverexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), TNBC  tests negative for all three .2 \nApproximately 15% of breast cancer tumors (300,000 cases annually) are considered triple negative  which \nis the most aggressive breast cancer subtype .1,2 First-line treatment for advanced or metastatic TNBC usually \nconsists of chemotherapy  alone or in combination with  an immunotherapy  – options generally associated\n4 \n with response  rates between  30% to 50%.2,3,4 Among patients with tumors that do respond to initial \ntreatment, disease progression is common and rapid, often occurring within two years .2,4,5,6 The a verage \noverall survival of patients living with metastatic TNBC is 12 to 18 months, with only about 12% of patients \nliving five years following diagnosis.7,8 \n \nTROP2 is a protein  broadly expressed in several solid tumors, including TNBC.9 TROP2 is associated with \nincreased tumor progression and poor survival in patients with breast cancer .9,10 \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019  and datopotamab deruxtecan in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi \nSankyo maintains exclusive rights for each AD C. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and \nsupply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nAbout Datopotamab Deruxtecan (Dato -DXd)  \nDatopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) is an investigational TROP2 directed ADC.

All grade i nterstitial lung disease rates were low.   \n \nMore than two million people worldwide are diagnosed with breast cancer each year.1 HR positive, HER2 \nlow or negative breast cancer is the most common subtype, accounting for more than 65% of diagnosed \ncases.1,2 Standard initial treatment for these patients is endocrine therapy but most patients with advanced \ndisease will develop resistance, underscoring the need for additional options.3,4 TROP2 is a protein \nbroadly expressed in HR positive, HER2 low or negative breast cancer.5,6\n2 \n “The positive topline results from TROPION -Breast01  demonstrate the potential for datopotamab \nderuxtecan to become an important treatment option for patients with HR positive, HER2 low or negative \nbreast cancer  in the second -line metastatic setting ,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi \nSankyo. “We look forward to realizing the full potential of this TROP2  directed antibody drug conjugate \nacross breast cancer subtypes  through our ongoing phase 3 program, including two trials in patients with \ntriple negative breast cancer.”   \n \n“Today’s TROPION -Breast01 news is a significant development for patients with HR positive, HER2 \nlow or negative metastatic breast cancer  whose tumors have become insensitive to endocrine therapy and \nwho currently face poor outcomes ,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD , Executive Vice President, \nOncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “ We are encouraged by these positive results .”  \n \nDetailed results  from  the TROPION -Breast01 trial will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and \nshared with regulatory  authorities.  \n \nDaiichi Sankyo  and AstraZeneca have two additional phase 3 trials evaluating datopotamab deruxtecan in \nbreast cancer. TROPION -Breast02 is comparing datopotamab deruxt ecan to chemotherapy in patients \nwith previously untreated locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) \nwho are not candidates for anti -PDL1 therapy. TROPION -Breast03 is evaluating datopotamab deruxtecan \nwith and without durvalumab versus investigator’s choice of therapy  in patients with stage I -III TNBC \nwith residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy.  \n \nAbout TROPION -Breast 01 \nTROPION -Breast01  is global, randomized, multicenter, open -label phase 3 trial evaluating the safety and \nefficacy of datopotamab derux tecan versus investigator’s choice of single -agent chemotherapy (eribulin, \ncapecitabine, vinorelbine or gemcitabine) in patients with inoperable or metastatic HR  positive, HER2 \nlow or negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or  IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer  who have progress ed on or are not \nsuitable for endocrine therapy per investigator assessment  and at least one systemic therapy . \n \nThe dual primary endpoints of TROPION -Breast01 are PFS as assessed by blinded independent central \nreview (BICR)  and OS. Key secondary endpoints include objective response rate, duration of response, \ninvestigator  assessed PFS , disease control rate  and time to first subseque nt therapy .\n3 \n TROPION -Breast01 enrolled  more than 700 patients at sites in Asia, Europe, North Ameri ca, South \nAmerica  and Africa . For more information visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout HR Positive, HER2 Low or Negative Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer in the world and a leading cause of cancer -related death.1 More \nthan two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2020 with nearly 685,000 deaths globally.1  \n \nBreast cancer is considered HR positive, HER2 low or negative when tumors test positive for estrogen \nand/or progesterone hormone receptors and negative for HER2 (measured as HER2 score of I HC 0, IHC \n1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -).2,7 HR positive, HER2 low or negative breast cancer is the most common subtype, \naccounting for more than 65% of diagnosed cases.2 Approximately 30% of patients diagnosed with HR \npositive, HER2 low or negative metastatic breast cancer are expected to live five years after their \ndiagnosis.2  \n \nTROP2 is a protein broadly expressed in several solid tumors, including HR positive , HER2 low  or \nnegative breast cancer.5 TROP2 expression is associated with increased tumor progression and poor \nsurvival in patients with breast cancer.5,6  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019  and datopotamab deruxtecan in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi \nSankyo maintains exclusive rights  for each ADC .

The \nrecommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission, which has the authority to grant  \nmarketing authorizations for medicines in the EU.  \n \nIn the trial, ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) demonstrated a confirmed objective response rate (ORR)  of 49.0% (95% \nconfidence interval [CI] : 39.0-59.1)  and disease control rate (DCR) of 93.1% (95% CI: 86.4 -97.2) , as \nassessed by blinded independent central review (BICR)  in patients with previously treated advanced  or \nmetastatic HER2  mutant NSCLC. O ne (1.0%) complete response (CR) and 49 (48.0%) partial responses (PR) \nwere observed. The median duration of response (DoR)  was 16.8 months (95% CI : 6.4-not estimable [NE ]). \nMedian follow -up was 11.5 months in the 5.4 mg/kg arm (n=102) at time of data cutoff of December 23, \n2022.\n2 \n “ENHERTU is the first therapy  to demonstrate a  strong and  durable tumor response in patients with \npreviously treated HER2  mutant advanced  non-small cell lung cancer, validat ing HER2 as  an actionable \ntarget in lung cancer a nd supporting the potential to provide a much -needed option for these patients ,” said \nKen Ta keshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “This CHMP opinion is a positive step forward in \nadvancing  this HER2 directed  antibody drug conjugate for these patients and we look forward to the \nEuropean Commission ’s decision.”  \n \n“HER2  mutant non -small cell lung cancer is an aggressive form of lung cancer that often affects younger \npatients and has a poor prognosis, with limited approved therapies,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, \nExecutive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca.  “This milestone recognizes the unmet  need in the \nEuropean Union and if approved, ENHERTU will provide the first targeted treatment option for these \npatients.”  \n \nIn DESTINY -Lung02, the safety profile of ENHERTU at the 5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg doses were cons istent \nwith other trials of ENHERTU with no new safety signals observed. A favorable safety profile was observed \nin patients treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg. Grade 3 or higher treatment -related treatment emergent \nadverse events ( TEAEs ) occurred in 38.6% of all patients receiving ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg. The most \ncommon grade 3 or higher TEAEs were neutropenia (18.8%) and anemia (10.9%). There were 13 cases  \n(12.9%)  of treatment -related interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis reported in the 5.4 mg/kg arm as \ndetermined by an independent adjudication committee.

These results , along with the first report on \nprogression- free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) , were  presented today ( MA 13.10 ) at the IASLC \n2023 World Conference on Lung Cancer hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung \nCancer (#WCLC23) and simultaneously published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology . \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly \ndeveloped and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo (TSE:4568) and AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN).   \n \nAt the primary analysis, a  confirmed objective response rate (ORR)  of 49.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: \n39.0-59.1) in the 5.4 mg/kg arm and 56.0% (95% CI: 41.3- 70.0) in the 6.4 mg/kg arm  was observed  as \nassessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). One (1.0%) complete response (CR) and 49 (48.0%) \npartial  responses (PR) were observed in the 5.4 mg/kg arm and two (4.0%) CRs and 26 (52.0%) PRs were \nobserved in the 6.4 mg/kg arm. The disease control rate (DCR) was 93.1% ( 95% CI: 86.4-97.2) at the 5.4 \nmg/kg dose and 92.0% ( 95% CI: 80.8-97.8) at the 6.4 mg/kg dose. The median duration of response (DoR)  \nwas 16.8 months (95% CI: 6.4-not estimable [NE]) in the 5.4 mg/kg arm  and was not reached in the 6.4 \nmg/kg arm (95% CI: 8.3- NE).  \n \nMedian PFS as assessed by BICR was 9.9 months (95% CI: 7.4-NE) in the 5.4 m g/kg arm and 15.4 months \n(95% CI: 8.3-NE) in the 6.4 mg/kg arm. Median OS was 19.5 months (95% CI: 13.6-NE) in the 5.4 mg/kg\n2 \n arm and not reached (95% CI: 12.1-NE) in the 6.4 mg/kg arm. Median follow -up was 11.5 months in the  \n5.4 mg/kg arm (n=102) and 11.8 months in the 6.4 mg/kg arm (n=50) at time of data cutoff of December 23, \n2022. \n \n“Th e  primary results from  DESTINY -Lung02 demonstrate t hat ENHERTU  continues to show strong and \ndurable tumor responses for patients treated at either dose ,” said Pasi A. Jänne , MD, PhD, Director, Lowe \nCenter for Thoracic Oncology  and Belfer Center for Applied Cancer Science , Dana -Farber Cancer Institute. \n“The favorable safety  profile  seen at the 5.4 mg/kg dose continues to support  the use of ENHERTU in the \ntreatment of patients  with  HER2  mutant non- small cell lung cancer,  a particularly aggressive form of the \ndisease where patients face a poor prognosis and  have historically had few options .”  \n \nIn DESTINY -Lung02, a favorable safety profile was observed in patients treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg \nwith no new safety signals identified at either dose. Grade 3 or higher treatment -related treatment  emergent \nadverse events (TEAEs) were lower  with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg versus 6.4 mg/kg. Grade 3 or higher \ntreatment -related TEAEs occurred in 38.6% and 58.0% of all patients receiving ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 \nmg/kg, respectively. The most common grade 3 or higher TEAEs were neutropenia (18.8% [5.4 mg/kg]; 36.0% [6.4 mg/kg]) and anemia (10.9% [5.4 mg/kg]; 16.0% [6.4 mg/kg]). There were 27 cases of treatment-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis reported as determined by an independent adjudication committee (12.9%  [n=13/101] in the 5.4 mg/kg arm; 28.0% [n=14/50] in the 6.4 mg/kg arm). In the 5.4 \nmg/kg arm, t he majority of ILD cases were low grade (grade 1 or 2 [10.9% ; four grade 1 and seven grade 2 \nevents] ) with one grade 3 event, zero grade 4 events and one grade 5 event observed. In the 6.4 mg/kg arm, \nthe majority of ILD cases were low grade (grade 1 or 2 [26.0% ; four grade 1 and nine grade 2 events] ) with \nzero grade 3 events, zero grade 4 events and one grade 5 event observed.  \n \n“The disease control achieved  by more  than 90% of patients  with  previously treated HER2  mutant non -small \ncell lung cancer in the primary analysis of DESTINY -Lung02 reinforces the efficacy  we have already seen \nwith ENHERTU in this hard- to-treat disease,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. \n“These results, along with encouraging progression-free survival and overall survival findings reported for \nthe first time, demonstrate the potential role of ENHERTU as an important treatment  option for this patient \npopulation.”  \n \n“These results from DESTINY -Lung02 highlight that HER2 is an actionable target in lung cancer and \nreinforce the importance of testing for predictive biomarkers, including HER2 alterations  in lung cancer, at \nthe time of diagnosis  to accurately identify patients who may be able to benefit from a targeted  treatment ,” \nsaid Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D , AstraZeneca. “The data \nalso reaffirm our belief in ENHERTU as a potential new targeted treatment option  for patien ts who have \nhistorically had limited options.”\n3 \n  \nPatients in the DESTINY -Lung02 trial received a median of two prior cancer therapies in each ENHERTU \narm (5.4 mg/kg: range 1- 12; 6.4 mg/kg: range 1- 7). HER2  mutations were primarily in the kinase domain \n(5.4 mg/kg: 97.1%; 6.4 mg/kg: 100%). Baseline central  nervous system metastases were present in 34.3% of \npatients in the 5.4 mg/kg arm and 44.0% of patients in the 6.4 mg/kg arm. Median follow -up was 11.5 \nmonths ( range 1.1- 20.6) in the 5.4 mg/kg arm and 11.8 months ( range 0.6 -21.0) in the 6.4 mg/kg arm.  \n \nSum mary of DESTINY -Lung02 Primary Analysis Results  \n \nEfficacy Measure  ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg)  \nn=102i ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg)  \nn=50i \nConfirmed ORR (%) (95% CI)ii,iii 49.0% (39.0 -59.1)  56.0% (41.3 -70.0)  \n   CR (%)  1.0%  4.0%  \n   PR (%)  48.0%  52.0%  \n   SD (%)  44.1%  36.0%  \n   PD (%)  3.9%  4.0%  \n   NE (%)iv 2.9%  4.0%  \nDCR (95% CI) v, vi 93.1% (86.4 -97.2)  92.0% (80.8 -97.8)  \nMedian DoR (months) (95% CI)vi, vii 16.8 months  (6.4-NE) NE (8.3 -NE) \nMedian TTIR (months)vi  1.8 months  (1.2-7.0) 1.6 months (1.2-11.2)  \nMedian PFS (months) (95% CI)vi, viii 9.9 months (7.4-NE) 15.4 months (8.3-NE) \nMedian OS (months) (95% CI)vi, ix 19.5 months (13.6 -NE) NE (12.1 -NE) \nCI, confidence interval; CR, complete response; DCR, disease control rate; DoR, duration of response; NE, not estimable; ORR, objective response \nrate; OS, overall survival ; PD, progressive disease; PFS, progression -free survival; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease;  TTIR, time to initial \nresponse  \ni Data cut -off: As of December 23, 2022  \nii Proportion of patients with confirmed CR or PR assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1   \niii ORR is (CR + PR)  \niv Three patients were NE at 5.4 mg/kg (one patient never received treatment due to COVID -19; two patients discontinued before first tumor \nassessment); two patients were NE at 6.4 mg/kg (discontinued due to adverse event before first tumor assessment)  \nv DCR is (CR + PR + SD)  \nvi As assessed by BICR  \nvii 60.0% and 75.0% of patients in the 5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg arms , respectively, were censored  \nviii 56.9% and 60.0% of patients in the 5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg arms , respectively, were censored  \nix 63.7% and 72.0% of patients in the 5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg arms , respectively, were censored  \n \nAbout DESTINY- Lung02  \nDESTINY -Lung02 is a global , randomized  phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of  ENHERTU in \npatients with HER2 mutant unresectable and/ or metastatic NSCLC with disease recurrence or progression \nduring or after at least one regimen of prior anticancer therapy that must have contained a platinum -based \nchemotherapy.

Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n Contraindications  \nNone.\n7 \n  \nWarnings and Precautions \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resol ved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomat ic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, ILD \noccurred in 12% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 1.0% of patients treated \nwith ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 5  months (range: 0.9 to 23). \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8  months (range: \n1.2 to  21). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with E NHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 10\n9/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, th en maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC \n<1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a \ndecrease in neut rophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Sixteen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased \nneutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 days (range: 2  to 664). \nFebrile neutropenia was reported in 1.1% of patients.  \n \nLocall y Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty- one percen t had \nGrade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients. \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment \nwithin 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40- 45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt\n8 \n ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from \nbaseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume \ntreatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is \n>20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF asse ssment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been stud ied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to \ninitiation of treatment.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with  ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \nLVEF decrease was reported in 3.6% of patients, of which 0.4% were Grade 3. \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated w ith \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and f or \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by one level. \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in 984 \npatients in Study DS8201-A-J101 (NCT0256490 0), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -\nBreast04, and DESTINY -Lung02.

The median duration of treatment was 14 months (range: 0.7 to 30). \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 19% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were vomiting, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, pyrexia, and \nurinary tract infection. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients including COVID-19 \nand sudden death (one patient each).\n9 \n  \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 14% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis accounted for 8%. \nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, \nthromboc ytopenia, pneumonia, nausea, fatigue, and ILD/pneumonitis. Dose reductions occurred in 21% of \npatients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction \nwere nausea, neutropenia, and fatigue. \n \nThe most common (≥ 20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (76%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (70%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (67%), decreased hemoglobin (64%), decreased lymphocyte count (55% ), increased alanine \naminotransferase (53%), decreased platelet count (52%), fatigue (49%), vomiting (49%), increased blood \nalkaline phosphatase (49%), alopecia (37%), hypokalemia (35%), constipation (34%), musculoskeletal pain \n(31%), diarrhea (29%), decreased appetite (29%), respiratory infection (22%), headache (22%), abdominal pain \n(21%), increased blood bilirubin (20%), and stomatitis (20%). \n \nHER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nDESTINY-Breast04  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 371 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ \nor IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \nDESTINY -Breast04. The median duration of treatment was 8 months (range: 0.2 to  33) for patients who \nreceived ENHERTU.  \n Serious adverse reactions occurred in 28% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were ILD/pneumonitis, pneumonia, dyspnea, musculoskeletal pain, sepsis, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypercalcemia, nausea, pyrexia, and vomiting.

Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the l ast dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contracep tion: Females : ENHERTU can cause\n11 \n fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use \neffective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 883 patients with breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 \nyears and 3.6% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade \n3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (60%) as compared to younger patients (48%). \nOf the 101 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU \n5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65  years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positi ve gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU \n6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences \nin efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Rena l Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor. The recommended dosage of    \nENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times \nULN and any AST). \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n  \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Informatio n, including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout  Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare  company contributing to  the sustainable development of \nsociety  that discovers,  develops and delivers new standards of care to  enrich  the quality  of life around the \nworld.

The new medicine needs to have shown encouraging preliminary clinical results that demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint over available medicines.  \n The FDA granted the BTD for the treatment of metastatic HER2 positive solid tumors  based on resul ts from  \nthe ongoing DESTINY -PanTumor02\n phase 2 trial  with  supporting data from other trials  in the ENHERTU \nclinical development program. Results from a n interim analysis of DESTINY -PanTumor02 w ere presented  \nas a late-breaking oral presentation at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual\n2 \n Meeting in previously treated patients with HER2 expressing metastatic solid tumors including biliary tract, \nbladder, cervical,  endometrial, ovarian, pancreatic cancers and other tumors.  The BTD for the treatment of \nHER2 positive metastatic colorectal cancer was  based on final results from the DESTINY -CRC01  phase 2 \ntrial presented  at the 2022 ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium  (ASCO GI)  and primary results from \nthe DESTINY -CRC02  phase 2 trial  presented  at the 2023 ASCO Annual Meeting. \n “ENHERTU is the first HER2  directed t herapy to demonstrate a potential benefit across a series of difficult -\nto-treat cancers and these designations are recognition of the continued potential of this innovative \nmedicine ,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “ We remain committed  to \nexploring additional opportunities for ENHERTU in these tumor types with the goal of bringing this treatment to more patients as soon as possible.”  \n “This is  an important step in  bringing ENHERTU to  patients with a broad range of HER2  expressing solid \ntumors who currently face a poor prognosis,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice \nPresident, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “ We are encouraged by the  recently reported results from our pan -\ntumor and colorectal cancer  trials  that contributed  to these designations, and we look forward to working \nclosely with the FDA to  provide these patients with a potential new targeted  treatment  option.”  \n \nENHERTU has received seven BTDs and it s designation in HER2 expressing metastatic  solid tumors  \nrepresents the first time ENHERTU  has been granted this designation in a tumor agnostic setting . \nENHERTU previously received BTDs for three indications in breast cancer, including HER2 low metastatic \nbreast cancer, second -line HER2 positive m etastatic breast cancer and later -line HER2 positive metastatic \nbreast cancer. Two additional BTDs for ENHERTU were granted for HER2  (ERBB2 ) mutant metastatic non -\nsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer.  \n About DESTINY- PanTumor02  \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 is a global, multicent er, multi -cohort, open- label phase 2 trial evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) for the treatment of HER2 expressing tumors ( IHC 3+ or IHC \n2+), including biliary tract cancer, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and other  tumo rs. \n  The primary efficacy endpoint of DESTINY-PanTumor02 is confirmed objective response rate (ORR ) as \nassessed by inves tigator. Secondary endpoints include duration of response ( DoR ), progression- free survival \n(PFS), overall survival ( OS), disease control rate (DCR) , safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics. \n DESTINY -PanTumor02 has enrolled 268 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America.

Secondary endpoints include DCR , DoR, PFS,  OS and safety . \nTwo additional exploratory cohorts enrolled patients whose tumors had lower levels of HER2 expression \n(HER2 IHC 2+/ISH - [n=15], and HER2 IHC 1+ [n=18], respectively).  \n \nDESTINY -CRC01 enrolled 86 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe  and N orth America. For more \ninformation about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov .  \n \nAbout DESTINY- CRC02  \nDESTINY -CRC02 is a global, randomized, two arm, parallel, multicenter phase 2 trial evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of two doses (5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg) of ENHERTU in patients with locally advanced, \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or I HC 2+/ISH+)  colorectal cancer of BRAF wild -type, or \nRAS wild -type and RAS mutant tumor types previously treated with standard therapy. The trial was \nconducted in two stages. In the first stage, patients (n=80) were randomized 1:1 to receive either 5.4 mg/k g \nor 6.4 mg/kg of ENHERTU. In the second stage, additional patients (n=42) were enrolled in the 5.4 mg/kg arm.  \n \nThe primary endpoint is confirmed ORR as assessed by blinded independent central review . Secondary \nendpoints include DoR, DCR, investigator- assessed confirmed ORR, clinical benefit ratio, PFS, OS  and \nsafety.  \n DESTINY -CRC02 enrolled 122 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America.

HER2 overexpression has been observed at rates from 1% to 28% in these solid \ntumors.1,2 There is an unmet need for effective therapies for certain HER2 expressing solid tumors, \nparticularly for those who have progressed on or are refractory to standard of care therapies as there are \ncurrently no approved HER2 dir ected therapies for biliary tract, bladder, cervical, endometrial, ovarian and \npancreatic cancers.5,6 \n \nColorectal cancer is the third most common and second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide \nwith more than 1.9 million patients diagnosed and more  than 935,000 deaths globally in 2020.11 \nApproximately 25% of patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis, meaning the disease has spread to \ndistant organs and about 50% of patients with colorectal cancer will eventually develop metastases.12 For \npatients with metastatic disease, up to 5% are HER2 overexpressing.3,4  \n \nAbout ENHERTU  ENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam- trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 50 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior anti -\nHER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy based on the results from \nthe DESTINY -Breast0 3 trial.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 40 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior \nsystemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Israel, Japan and under accelerated approval in the U.S. for the \ntreatment of adult patients  with unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2  \n(ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected by a locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior\n5 \n systemic therapy based on the results from the  DESTINY -Lung02 trial. Continued approval in the U.S. for \nthis indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  and/or \nDESTINY -Gastric02  trials.   \n \nAbout the EN HERTU  Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers.  Trials in combination with other anticancer \ntreatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  \n About the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU  in March 2019 and dato potamab  deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the \nmanufacturing and supply of ENHERTU  and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n About the DXd ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe DXd ADC portfolio of Daii chi Sankyo currently consists of five ADCs in clinical development across \nmultiple types of cancer. ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato- DXd), a \nTROP2 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with Astr aZeneca. Three \nadditional Daiichi Sankyo DXd ADCs include patritumab deruxtecan (HER3- DXd), a HER3 directed ADC, \nifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd; DS -7300), a B7- H3 directed ADC, and raludotatug deruxtecan (R -DXd; DS -\n6000), a CDH6 directed ADC.  Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology to target and deliver a cytotoxic payload \ninside cancer cells that express a specific cell surface antigen , each ADC consists of a monoclonal antibody \nattached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloa ds (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide-\nbased cleavable linkers.  \n \nDatopotamab deruxtecan, ifinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan and raludota tug deruxtecan are \ninvestigational  medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy \nhave not been established.\n6 \n ENHERTU U.S. Important Safety Information  \n \nIndications  \n \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients wit h:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based \nregimen either:  \n– In the metastatic setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six \nmonths of completing therapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH- ) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -\napproved test, who have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease \nrecurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 \n(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test, and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advan ced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY  \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n Contraindications  \nNone.  \nWarnings and Precautions \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resol ved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomat ic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as\n7 \n ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, ILD \noccurred in 12% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 1.0% of patients treated \nwith ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 5  months (range: 0.9 to 23). \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastr ic or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8  months (range: \n1.2 to  21). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 10\n9/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, t hen maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 10\n9/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for m ore than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a \ndecrease in neu trophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Sixteen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased \nneutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 days (range: 2  to 664). \nFebrile neutropenia was reported in 1.1% of patients.  \n \nLocal ly Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty- one perce nt had \nGrade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients. \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment \nwithin 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40- 45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from \nbaseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume \ntreatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF asse ssment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU \nhas not been stud ied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to \ninitiation of treatment.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with  ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \nLVEF decrease was reported in 3.6% of patients, of which 0.4% were Grade 3.\n8 \n  \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by one level. \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in 984 \npatients in Study DS8201-A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY- Breast01, DESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -\nBreast04, and DESTINY -Lung02.

Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant wi thin 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiat ion of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatri c Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 883 patients with breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 \nyears and 3.6% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade \n3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (60%) as compared to younger patients (48%). \nOf the 101 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU \n5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety\n11 \n were observed between patients ≥65  years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU \n6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences \nin efficacy or safety were observed be tween patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequentl y. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increase d toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.

ENHERTU  previously received an Orphan Drug  Designation  by the Japan MHLW for this \ntumor type , a designation that provided priority review of the application.  \n \nIn DESTINY -Lung02, a  pre-specified interim analysis of patients with previously -treated HER2  mutant \nNSCLC showed that ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) demonstrated a confirmed objective response rate ( ORR) of \n53.8% (n=52; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 39.5-67.8) in patients with unresectable advanced or recurrent \nNSCLC  with activating  HER2 (ERBB2 ) mutations after prior chemotherapy  as assessed by blinded \nindependent central review (BICR).  \n \n“HER2  mutant non-small cell lung cancer  is a rare but serious disease  and now patients and physicians in \nJapan have the potential to benefit from the first HER2 directed treatment option approved specifically for \nthis type of lung cancer ,” said Wataru Takasaki, PhD, Executive Officer, Head of R&D Division in Japan, \nDaiichi Sankyo . “This is the fourth indication secured for ENHERTU in Japan in just over three years and \nthe second approval this year alone , underscoring the benefit of this medicine across a range of HER2 \ntargetable cancers.”\n2 \n  \nIn DESTINY -Lung02 , the safety profile of ENHERTU was consistent with previous clinical trials with no \nnew safety concerns identified. Treatment related adverse events (AEs)  occurred in 93 patients (92.1%)  \ntreated with ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) . The most common treatment related AEs were nausea  (59.4%), \ndecreas ed neutrophil count (33.7%), anemia (28.7%), decreased appetite (28. 7%), fatigue (25.7%), \nconstipation (24.8%), decreased leukocyte count (23.8%)  and vomiting (22.8%). In Japanese patients, \ninterstitial lung disease ( ILD) occurred in 2.7% of patients treated with 5.4 mg/kg of ENHERTU  at interim \nanalysis .  \n \nENHERTU  is approved in Japan with a Warning for ILD. As cases of ILD, including fatal cases, have \noccurred in ENHERTU -treated patients, ENHERTU is to be used in close collaboration with a re spiratory \ndisease expert. Patients  should be  closely observed  during therapy by monitoring for early signs or symptoms \nof ILD (such as dyspnea, cough or fever) and perform ing regular  peripheral artery  oxygen saturation (SpO 2) \ntests, chest X -ray scans and chest CT scans . If abnormalities are observed, discontinue administration of \nENHERTU and take appropriate measures , such as corticosteroid administration. Prior to initiation of \nENHERTU therapy, a chest CT scan should be performed and medical history t aken to confirm the absence \nof any comorbidity or history of ILD with the patient and carefully consider the eligibility of the patient for \nENHERTU therapy.  \n \nThe efficacy and safety of ENHERTU as a neoadjuvant , adjuvant or first -line metastatic therapy for the \ntreatment of patients with HER2 (ERBB2 ) mutant unresectable advanced or recurrent NSCLC has not been \nestablished. ENHERTU should be administered only to patients  with NSCLC with  confirmed HER2 \n(ERBB2 ) mutations  as detected by an approved te st.  \n \nAbout DESTINY -Lung02  \nDESTINY -Lung02 is a global phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of two doses (5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 \nmg/kg) of ENHERTU in patients with HER2 mutant metastatic NSCLC with disease recurrence or \nprogression during or after at least one regimen of prior anticancer therapy that must have contained a \nplatinum -based chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg (n=101) or \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg (n=50)  every three weeks . \n \nThe primary endpoint of the stu dy is confirmed ORR as assessed by BICR. Secondary endpoints include \nconfirmed disease control rate, durat ion of response and progression free survival assessed by investigator \nand BICR, overall survival and safety. DESTINY -Lung02 enrolled 151 patients at multiple sites, including \nAsia, Europe, Oceania and North America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov .\n3 \n About  HER2  Mutant  NSCLC             \nLung cancer is the second most common form of cancer globally, with more than two million cases \ndiagnosed in 2020.1 In Japan, lung cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer, with more than 138,000 cases \ndiagnosed in 2020.1 Prognos is is particularly poor for patients with metastatic NSCLC, as only \napproximately 9% will live beyond five years after diagnosis.3 In Japan, only 18.2% of patients with \nmetastatic NSCLC will live more than  three years following  diagnosis.2 \n \nHER2 is a tyro sine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors, including lung, breast, gastric and colorectal cancers. Certain HER2 (ERBB2 ) gene alterations (called \nHER2  mutations) have been identified in patients with non-squamous NSCLC as a distinct molecular target, \nand occur in approximately 2% to 4% of patients with this type of lung cancer .4,5 While HER2  gene \nmutations can occur in a range of patients, they are more commonly found in patients with NSCLC who are \nyounger, female and have never smoked.6 HER2 gene mutations have been independently associated with \ncancer cell growth and poor prognosis, with a n increased incidence of brain metastases.7  Next -generation \nsequencing is being utilized in the identification of  HER2  (ERBB2 ) mutations.8 \n \nAlthough the role of anti -HER2 treatment is well established in breast and gastric cancers, there were  no \napprove d HER2 directed therapies  for NSCLC in Japan prior to th is approval of ENHERTU  in unresectable \nor metastatic HER2  mutant NSCLC . \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 m onoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor \npayload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 50 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior anti -\nHER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant  or adjuvant setting, and have \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy based on the results from \nthe DESTINY -Breast03  trial. \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 40 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ in-situ hybridization (ISH) -) breast cancer who \nhave received a prior systemic therapy in the met astatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or\n4 \n within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  \ntrial. \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Israel , Japan and under accelerated approval in the U.S . for the \ntreatment of adult patients  with unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2  \n(ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected by a  locally or regionally approved test, and who have received a prior \nsystemic therapy  based on the results from the DESTINY -Lung02  trial. Continued approval in the U.S. for \nthis indication may be  contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is  approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  and/or \nDESTINY -Gastric02  trials.   \n \nAbout the ENHERTU  Clinical Development  Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers.  Trials in combination with other anticancer \ntreatments, such as immunotherapy, also are under way.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU  in March 2019  and datopotamab  deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020 , except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi San kyo is responsible for the \nmanufacturing and supply of ENHERTU  and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nAbout the DXd ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe DXd  ADC portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo currently consists of five ADCs in clinical development across \nmultiple types of cancer. ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC , and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd), a \nTROP2 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commerciali zed globally with AstraZeneca. Three \nadditional Daiichi Sankyo DXd ADCs include patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a HER3 directed ADC , \nifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd; DS -7300), a B7 -H3 directed ADC, and raludotatug deruxtecan (R -DXd; DS -\n6000), a CDH6 directe d ADC.  \n \nDesigned using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology to target and deliver a cytotoxic payload \ninside cancer cells that express a specific cell surface antigen, each ADC consists of a monoclonal antibody \nattached to a number of topoisome rase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -\nbased cleavable linkers.\n5 \n  \nDatopotamab deruxtecan, ifinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan and raludotatug deruxtecan are \ninvestigational medicines that have not been approved for  any indication in any country.

    "content": "Press Release  \n \nENHERTU® Demonstrated Clinically Meaningful Progression- Free \nSurvival and Overall Survival Across Multiple HER2 Expressing \nAdvanced Solid Tumors in DESTINY- PanTumor02 Phase 2 Trial  \n \n• Data support ongoing discussions with global health  authorities  \n \nTokyo and Basking Ridge, NJ – ( July 27, 2023)  – Topline  results from the primary analysis of the ongoing \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 phase 2 trial showed ENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan) demonstrated clinically \nmeaningful progression- free survival (PFS) and overall surv ival (OS) in previously treated patients across \nmultiple HER2  expressing advanced solid tumors, two secondary endpoints of the trial . \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2  directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly \ndeveloped and commerciali zed by Daiichi Sankyo (TSE:4568)  and AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) . \n \nIn the primary analysis, ENHERTU  also continued to show durable responses based on investigator -assessed \nconfirmed objective response rate (ORR), the primary endpoint of the trial, and duration of response (DoR), \na secondary endpoint , reinforcing the r esults from an interim analysis of t he trial recently presented  at the \n2023 American Society of Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting.  \n \nThe DESTINY -PanTumor02 phase 2 trial is evaluat ing the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU in  patients with \npreviously treated locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic HER2  expressing solid tumors not eligible for \ncurative therapy, including biliary tract, bladder, cervical, endometrial, ovarian, pancreatic and other  cancers.   \n \nThese data will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and wi ll support ongoing discussions  with \nglobal health  authorities.  \n \n“These updated results from the DESTINY -PanTumor02 trial are important as we work to reshape the \nclinical landscape in HER2  expressing advanced cancers where patients  currently have limited treatment \noptions and face a poor prognosis ,” said Mark Rutstein , MD, Global Head, Oncology Development , Daiichi \nSankyo. “ The overall survival demonstrated by ENHERTU in these patients is a significant  step forward in \nthe potential to advance current  standards  of care and offer new options for patients with HER2  expressing  \ncancers.”\n2  \n“The progression- free survival and overall survival results for ENHERTU  alongside the continued robust and \ndurable tumor responses  seen with further follow -up underscore the potential value of this important \nmedicine for patients with HER2  expressing cancers  who currently have no targeted treatment options ,” said  \nCristian Mass acesi, MD, Chief Medical Officer and Oncology Chief Develo pment Officer , AstraZeneca. \n“With a high unmet need in these cancers, we are working with health authorities to bring ENHERTU  to \npatients with HER2 expressing cancers that could potentially benefit from this medicine as quickly as possible .” \n The safety profile observed in the primary analysis  was consistent with prior data and with other trials of \nENHERTU  with no new safety concerns identif ied. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) rates and severity were \nconsistent with those observed in other trials of ENHERTU, with a low rate of grade 5 ILD observed as determined by an independent adjudication committee . \n \nAbout DESTINY- PanTumor02  \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 is a global, multicent er, multi -cohort, open- label phase 2 trial evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) for the treatment of HER2 expressing tumor s, including \nbiliary tract cancer, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer \nand other  tumo rs. \n  The primary efficacy endpoint of DESTINY -PanTumor02 is confirmed ORR as assessed by investigator. \nSecondary endpoints include DoR, PFS, OS , disease control rate, safet y, tolerability and pharmacokinetics.  \n \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 has enrolled 268 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America. For \nmore information about the trial, visit ClinicalTr ials.gov. \n \nAbout HER2 Expression in Solid Tumors  \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth- promoting protein expressed on the surface of various tissue cells \nthroughout the body and is involved in normal cell growth.\n1,2  In some cancer s, HER2 expression is  amplified \nor the cells have activating mutations.1,3 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a result of HER2 gene \namplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis.4  \n \nWhile HER2 directed therapies have been used to treat breast , gastric , lung and colorectal cancers,  more \nresearch is needed in evaluating their potential in treating other HER2 expressing tumor types .2,5,6  \n \nHER2 is an emerging biomarker in biliary tract, bladder, cervical, endometrial, ovarian and pancreatic \ncancers.3 Testing is not routinely performed in these additional tumor types and as a result, available\n3 literature is limited. HER2 overexpression (IHC 3+) has been observed at rates from 1% to 28% in these \nsolid tumors .7,8 There is an unmet need for effective therapies for certain HER2 expressing solid tumors, \nparticularly for those who have progressed on or are refractory to standard of care therapies as there are \ncurrently no approved HER2 directed therapies for these cancers.2,9 \n \nAbout ENHERTU   \nENHERTU  (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU  is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU  consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor \npayload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 50 countries for the treatment of adult patients  with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior  anti-\nHER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have  \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy  based on the results from  \nthe DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 40 countries for th e treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 low (immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+ or IHC 2+/ in-situ hybridization \n(ISH) -) breast cancer who have received a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed \ndisease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from  the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Israel and under accelerated approval in the U.S . for the treatment of \nadult patients  with unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have \nactiva ting HER2  (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected by a locally or regionally approved test, and who have \nreceived a prior systemic therapy  based on the results from the DESTINY -Lung02  trial. Continued approval \nfor this indication in the U.S. may be  contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a \nconfirmatory trial.  \n ENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  and/or \nDESTINY -Gastric02  trials.\n4 About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers.

Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for ef fective contraception.  \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n Warnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A highe r incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptom s of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resol ved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomat ic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n Metastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, ILD \noccurred in 12% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 1.0% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 5  months (range: 0.9 to 23). \n Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastr ic or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8  months (range: \n1.2 to  21). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated.\n6 For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia  (ANC \n<1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic  breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a \ndecrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Sixteen percent had Grade  3 or 4 decreased \nneutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 days (range: 2  to 664). \nFebrile neutropenia was reported in 1.1% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty- one percent had \nGrade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported i n 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment \nwithin 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40- 45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from \nbaseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is \n>20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF asse ssment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU \nhas not been stud ied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to \ninitiation of treatment.  \n Metastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with  ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \nLVEF decrease was reported in 3.6% of patients, of which 0.4% were Grade  3. \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated w ith \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade  2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and f or \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.\n7 Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in 984 \npatients in Study DS8201- A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -\nBreast04, and DESTINY -Lung02.

Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were vomiting, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, pyrexia, and \nurinary tract infection. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients including COVID -19 \nand sudden death (one patient each).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 14% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis accounted for 8%. \nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose  interruption were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, pneumonia, nausea, fatigue, and ILD/pneumonitis. Dose reductions occurred in 21% of \npatients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction \nwere nausea, neutropenia, and fatigue.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (76%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (70%), increased aspartate \naminotransferase (67%),  decreased hemoglobin (64%), decreased lymphocyte count (55%), increased alanine \naminotransferase (53%), decreased platelet count (52%), fatigue (49%), vomiting (49%), increased blood \nalkaline phosphatase (49%), alopecia (37%), hypokalemia (35%), constipat ion (34%), musculoskeletal pain \n(31%), diarrhea (29%), decreased appetite (29%), respiratory infection (22%), headache (22%), abdominal pain (21%), increased blood bilirubin (20%), and stomatitis (20%).  \n \nHER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nDESTINY- Breast04  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 371 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ \nor IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \nDESTINY -Breast04. The median duration of treatment was 8  months (range: 0.2 to  33) for patients who \nreceived ENHERTU.  \n Serious adverse reactions occurred in 28% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were ILD/pneumonitis, pneumonia, dyspnea, musculoskeletal \npain, sepsis, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypercalcemia, nausea, pyrexia, and vomiting. Fatalities due to \nadverse reactions occurred in 4% of patients including ILD/pneumonitis (3 patients); sepsis (2  patients); and\n8 ischemic colitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, dyspnea, febrile neutropenia, general physical \nhealth deterioration, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure (1 patient each).  \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 16% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis accounted for 8%. \nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 39% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, fatigue, anemia, \nleukopenia, COVID -19, ILD/pneumonitis, increased transam inases, and hyperbilirubinemia. Dose reductions \noccurred in 23% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia.  \n The most common (≥20%) adve rse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (76%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (70%), decreased hemoglobin (64%), decreased neutrophil count (64%), \ndecreased lymphocyte count (55%), fatigue (54%), decreased platelet count (44%), alopecia (40%), vomiting \n(40%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (38%), increased alanine aminotransferase (36%), constipation \n(34%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (34%), decreased appetite (32%), musculoskeletal pain (32%), \ndiarrhea (27%), and hypokalemia (25%).  \n Unresectable or Metastatic HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nDESTINY -Lung02 evaluated two dose levels (5.4 mg/kg [n=101] and 6.4 mg/kg [n=50]); however, only the \nresults for the recommended dose of 5.4  mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks are des cribed below due to \nincreased toxicity observed with the higher dose in patients with NSCLC, including ILD/pneumonitis.  \n \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 101 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -mutant \nNSCLC who received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every three weeks in DESTINY -Lung02. \nNineteen percent of patients were exposed for >6 months.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients receiving ENHERTU.

Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly or \npaclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) for patients who received ENHERTU. \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of pat ients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in  \n2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred \nin one patient each (0.8%).\n9 ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%.

T he most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, leukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions,  including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased hemoglobin \n(75%), decreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (72%), decreased lymphocyte count (70%), decreased platelet count (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), increased aspartate \naminotransferase (58%), fatigue (55%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (54%), increased alanine \naminotransferase (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), increased \nblood bilirubin (24%), pyrexia (24%) , and alopecia (22%).  \n Use in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a \nbreastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female partne rs of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU hav e not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 883 patients with breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 \nyears and 3.6% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between  patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade \n3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (60%) as compared to younger patients (48%). \nOf the 101 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU \n5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety \nwere observed between patients ≥65  years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with \nlocally advanced or me tastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU \n6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences \nin efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not b een established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhi bitor. The recommended dosage of    \nENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times \nULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n  Please see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide .\n10  \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is an innovative global healthcare company contributing to the sustainable development of society that discovers, develops and delivers new standards of care to enrich the quality of life around the world.

    "content": "Press Release  \n \nENHERTU® Approved in China as the First HER2 Directed Therapy \nfor Patients  with HER2 Low  Metastatic Breast Cancer  \n \n• Approval based on DESTINY- Breast04 results which showed Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s \nENHERTU reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 50% and increased median ove rall \nsurvival by more than six months versus chemotherapy  \n \nTokyo – ( July 12, 2023)  – Daiichi Sankyo (TSE:4568) and AstraZeneca’s (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN)  \nENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan) has been approved in China as a monotherapy indicated for the \ntreatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2  low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH- ) breast cancer \nwho have received a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during \nor within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy.   \n ENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 dire cted antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly \ndeveloped and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca. \n \nIn China, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women with more than  415,000 cases diagnosed in \n2020.1 Additionally, there were nearly 120,000 deaths, representing around 18% of global breast cancer \ndeaths.1 Approximately half of all breast cancers are considered  HER2 low.2,3,4 \n \nThe approval by China’s National Medical Products Administration  (NMPA) is based on the results of the \nDESTINY -Breast04  phase 3 trial  first presented  at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2022 \nAnnual Meeting and published in The New England Journal of Medicine . It follows the approval  granted by \nChina’s NMPA  in Feburary 2023 for ENHERTU in patients with  previously treated unresectable or \nmetastatic HER2 positive breast cancer.  \n In DESTINY -Breast04,  ENHERTU reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 50% versus \nphysician’s choice of chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40-0.63; p<0.0001) in all randomized patients with HER2 low metastatic breast cancer with either hormone receptor \n(HR) positive or HR negative disease. A median progression -free survival (PFS) of 9.9 months (95% CI: 9.0-\n11.3) was seen with ENHERTU versus 5.1 months (95% CI: 4.2-6.8) in those treated with chemotherapy as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). A 36% red uction in the risk of death (HR = 0.64; \n95% CI: 0.49-0.84; p=0.001) also was seen with ENHERTU compared to chemotherapy with a median\n2 \n overall survival (OS) of 23.4 months (95% CI: 20.0- 24.8) in patients treated with ENHERTU versus 16.8 \nmonths (95% CI: 14.5- 20.0) in those treated with chemotherapy.  \n \n“Historically breast cancer tumors with low levels of HER2 expression have been classified as HER2 \nnegative and have not been eligible for treatment with  HER2  directed therapies,”  said Binghe Xu, MD, \nDirector of the National Clinical Research Center for New Anticancer Drugs, Tenured Professor and Former \nDirector, the Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College . “With this approval in China based on the results of the DESTINY -Breast04 \ntrial, clinicians will now be able to identify and potentially treat a distinct patient population based on HER2 low status.”  \n “This approval of  ENHERTU for patients with HER2 low metastatic breast can cer, which comes  shortly  \nafter the approval of ENHERTU in patients with HER2  positive disease, marks the first time patients with \nHER2 low tumors will have the opportunity to be treated with a HER2 directed therapy ,” said Kiminori \nNagao, Head of the Asia, South & Central America (ASCA) Business Unit, Daiichi Sankyo. “ ENHERTU \nnow has the potential to become a new standard of care treatment option in China for a broad range of \npatients with  HER2  expressing  metastatic breast cancer .”\n  \n “Patients with HR positive or HR negative , HER2 low metastatic breast cancer previously had few effective \ntreatment options beyond chemotherapy ,” said Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology \nBusiness Unit, AstraZeneca . “The results from the DESTINY -Breast04 tri al show ENHERTU provides a \nsignificant improvement in outcomes compared to chemotherapy for patients whose tumors are determined \nto be HER2  low via  routine testing . This approval is an important advance in the way breast cancer is \nclassified and treated in China and supports our vision to bring ENHERTU  to more patients  worldwide\n.” \n The safety profile of ENHERTU in DESTINY -Breast04 was consistent with previous clinical trials with no \nnew safety concerns identified. Grade 3 or grade 4 treatment -related adverse events from a pooled safety \nanalysis of patients treated with ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) across multiple tumor types in clinical studies included neutropenia (16.3%), anemia (9.2%), fatigue (7.5%), leukopenia (6.3%), thrombocytopenia (5.9%), \nnausea (5.6%), lymphopenia (4.8%), transaminases increased (3.9%), hypokalemia (3.5%), vomiting (2.2%), pneumonia (1.9%), diarrhea (1.8%), decreased appetite (1.7%), febrile neutropenia (1.2%), dyspnea (1.2%), \nblood bilirubin increased (1.1%), ejection fraction decreased (1.1%), and musculoskeletal pain (1.1%). Grade 5 adverse reactions occurred in 1.5% of patients, including interstitial lung disease (I LD) (1.2%). \nDiscontinuation of therapy due to an adverse event occurred in 12.1% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse event associated with permanent discontinuation was ILD (8. 5%).\n3 \n About DESTINY- Breast04  \nDESTINY -Breast04 is a glob al, randomized, open- label, pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and  \nsafety of ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) versus physician’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin,  \ngemcitabine, paclitaxel or nab -paclitaxel) in patients with HR positive or HR neg ative, HER2 low  \nunresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with one or two prior lines of chemotherapy.  \nPatients were randomized 2:1 to receive either ENHERTU  or chemotherapy. \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY- Breast04 is PFS in patients with HR positive disease based on BICR.  \nKey secondary endpoints include PFS based on BICR in all randomized patients (HR positive and HR negative disease), OS in patients with HR positive disease and OS in all randomized patients (HR positive and HR negative disease). Other secondary endpoints include PFS based on investigator assessment, objective response rate based on BICR and on investigator assessment, duration of response based on BICR and safety. DESTINY-Breast04 enrolled 557 patients at mul tiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America.  \nFor more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.  \n About Breast Cancer and HER2 Expression  \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.\n5 More than two million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020 with nearly 685,000 \ndeaths globally.5 In China, breast cancer is the most com mon cancer in women with more than  415,000 cases \ndiagnosed in 2020.1 Additionally, there were nearly 120,000 deaths, representing approximately 18% of \nglobal breast cancer deaths.1 \n HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on t he surface of many types of \ntumors and is one of many biomarkers expressed in  breast cancer tumors.\n6 \n \nHER2 expression is determined by an immunohistochemistry ( IHC) test , which estimates the amount of \nHER2 protein on a cancer cell, and/or an in-situ hybridization ( ISH) test, which counts the copies of the \nHER2  gene in cancer cells.6,7 HER2 tests  provide IHC and ISH scores across the full HER2 spectrum  and are \nroutinely used to determine appropriate treatment options for patients with metastatic brea st cancer.6 HER2 \npositive cancers are currently defined as HER2 expression measured as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+, and HER2 \nnegative cancers are defined as HER2 expression measured as IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-.6 However, \napproximately half of all breast cancers are HER2 low, defined as a HER2 score of IHC 1+ or  \nIHC 2+/ISH -.2,3,4 HER2 low occurs in both HR positive and HR negative disease.8\n4 \n About ENHERTU   \nENHERTU  (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU  is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU  consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor \npayload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 50 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior anti -\nHER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 40 countries  worl dwide  for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior \nsystemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results of the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Israel and  under accelerated approval in the U.S. for the treatment of \nadult patients with unresectable or metastatic non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have \nactivating HER2 (ERBB2)  mutations, as detected by a locally or regionally approved test, and who have \nreceived a prior systemic therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Lung02  trial. Continued approval \nfor this indication in the U.S. may be contingent upon verification and descr iption of clinical benefit in a \nconfirmatory trial.  \n ENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries worldwide for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenoc arcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the \nDESTINY -Gastric01  and/or DESTIN Y-Gastric02  trials.  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU  Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers.  Trials in combination with other anticancer \ntreatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.\n5 \n About the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercial ize \nENHERTU  in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except  in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the \nmanufacturing and supply of ENHERTU  and da topotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nAbout the DXd ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe DXd ADC portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo currently consists of five ADCs in clinical development across  \nmultiple types of cancer.

These r esults will be presented today as a late-breaking \noral presentation ( abstract # LBA 3000) at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual \nMeeting.  \n  \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2  directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly \ndeveloped and commerciali zed by Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and AstraZeneca ( LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN ).   \n  \nIn the trial , previously treated patients (n=267) with HER2 expressing advanced solid tumors including \nbiliary tract, bladder, cervical, endometrial, ovarian , pancreatic cancers or other  tumors were treated with \nENHERTU . The results showed  a confirmed objective response rate (ORR) of 37.1%  as assessed by \ninvestigator at an interim analysis . Complete response (CR) was achieved in 5.6% (n=15)  of patients, 31.5% \n(n=84) achieved a partial response  (PR) and 46.1% (n=1 23) had  stable disease. The disease control rate \n(DCR) in the overall trial population was 68.2%  as assessed by investigator  at an interim analysis . The \nhighest response rates  were seen in patients with tumor HER2 expression of  immunohistochemistry ( IHC) 3+ \nas confirmed by central testing , where ENHERTU demonstrated a confirmed ORR of 61.3%.  \n Nearly  half (49.6%) of all patients in  DESTINY -PanTumor02 who achieved a response remained in response \nat one year . Median duration of response (DoR) was 11.8 months (95% confidence interval [ CI]: 9.8-NE) in \nthe overall trial population and 22.1 months ( 95% CI: 9.3-NE) in patients with IHC 3+ expression.\n2 \n “The DESTINY -PanTumor02 data  showed encouraging and durable response rates across a broad range of \nHER2  expressing solid tumors where there are currently no approved HER2 targeted treatments ,” said  Funda \nMeric- Bernstam, MD, Chair of the Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics at The University of \nTexas MD Anderson Cancer Center  and Principal Investigator for the trial . “Based on these results, \nENHERTU has the potential to benefit  specific patients with HER2 expressi ng advanced disease who \ncurrently have limited options and may face  a poor prognosis .”  \n \nThe safety profile observed in DESTINY -PanTumor02 was consistent with previous clinical trials of \nENHERTU with no new safety concerns identified. Grade 3 or higher treatment related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 38.6 % of patients. T he most common grade 3 or higher treatment \nrelated TEAEs  occurring in ≥ 5% of patients were neutropenia  (19.1%) , anemia (8.6%), fatigue (6.0%) and \nthrombocytopenia (5.2%) . In DESTINY -PanTumor02, 7.5% of patients experienced interstitial lung disease \n(ILD) o r pneumonitis related to treatment with ENHERTU as determined by an independent adjudication \ncommittee. The majority of ILD or pneumonitis events were low grade (grade 1 or 2) with one  grade 3 event , \nno grade 4 events  and one  grade 5 event observed.  \n “Nearly  half of patients who achieved a response with ENHERTU  as a late- line treatment for HER2 \nexpressing advanced solid tumors in  DESTINY -PanTumor02 remained in response at one year , \ndemonstrat ing the potential of this important medicine to provide benefit to patients with hard -to-treat \ncancers in need of new options ,” said Mark Rutstein , MD, Global Head, Oncology Development , Daiichi \nSankyo. “ The results further reinforce the important role of antibody drug conjuga tes like ENHERTU  to \nprovide  potential  new solutions to advance current standards of care in areas of high unmet need and improve  \nthe outcomes of patients .”  \n “While HER2 is an established biomarker in breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers, data from the \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 trial validate HER2 as an actionable biomarker across a broad range of tumor \ntypes,” said Cristian Massacesi, MD, Chief Medical Officer and Oncology Chief Development Officer, AstraZeneca. “ENHERTU is the first treatment to demo nstrate broad activity across HER2 expressing solid \ntumors where there are currently no approved HER2 directed therapies . These data will support our ongoing \nconversations with global health authorities as we look to bring ENHERTU to as many patients as po ssible.”  \n  In DESTINY -PanTumor 02, patients had r eceived a median of  two prior cancer therapies (range: 0 -13). Of \nthe 267 patients that had received treatment, 75 were IHC 3+ and 125 were IHC 2+ as determined by central testing. As of data cut -off on November 16, 2022, 44 patients remained on treatment.\n3 \n Summary of DESTINY -PanTumor02 Results  \nEfficacy \nMeasure  All \nPatients  Cervical  \n Endometrial  \n Ovarian  \n BTC  \n Pancreatic  \n Bladder  \n Otheri \nAll IHC Expression Levelsii \n(N) 267 40 40 40 41 25 41 40 \nConfirmed \nORR (%)  \n(Investigator \nAssessed)  37.1%  50.0%  57.5%  45.0%  22.0%  4.0%  39.0%  30.0%  \n   CR (%)  5.6% \n(n=15) 5.0% \n(n=2) 17.5%  \n(n=7) 10.0% \n(n=4) 2.4% \n(n=1) 0%  \n(n=0) 2.4% \n(n=1) 0%  \n(n=0) \n   PR (%)  31.5% \n(n=84) 45.0% \n(n=18) 40.0% \n(n=16) 35.0% \n(n=14) 19.5% \n(n=8) 4.0%  \n(n=1) 36.6% \n(n=15) 30.0% \n(n=12) \n   SD (%)  46.1% \n(n=1 23) 30.0% \n(n=1 2) 32.5% \n(n=1 3) 35.0% \n(n=1 4) 61.0% \n(n=2 5) 68.0% \n(n=1 7) 43.9% \n(n=1 8) 60.0% \n(n=2 4) \n   PD (%)  15.7% \n(n=42) 17.5% \n(n=7) 10.0%  \n(n=4) 17.5% \n(n=7) 17.1% \n(n=7) 28.0% \n(n=7) 17.1% \n(n=7) 7.5% \n(n=3) \nDCRiii at 12 \nweeks (%)  68.2% \n(n=182) 67.5% \n(n=27) 80.0% \n(n=32) 70.0% \n(n=28) 65.9% \n(n=27) 36.0% \n(n=9) 70.7% \n(n=29) 75.0% \n(n=30) \nMedian \nDoR, months (95% CI)  11.8 \n(9.8- NE) 9.8  \n(4.2- NE) NR  \n(9.9- NE) 11.3 \n(4.1- NE) 8.6  \n(2.1- NE) NR 8.7  \n(4.3-11.8) NR  \n(4.1- NE) \nIHC 3+ii \n(N) 75 8 13 11 16 2 16 9 \nConfirmed \nORR (%)  61.3% 75.0% 84.6% 63.6% 56.3% 0.0% 56.3% 44.4% \nIHC 2+ii \n(N) 125 20 17 19 14 19 20 16 \nConfirmed \nORR (%)  27.2% 40.0% 47.1% 36.8% 0.0% 5.3% 35.0% 18.8% \n \nBTC, biliary tract cancer; CI, confidence interval; CR, complete response; DCR, disease control rate; DoR, duration of response; IHC, \nimmunohistochemistry; NE, not estimable; NR, not reached; ORR , objective response rate; PD, progressive disease; PR, partial response; SD, stable \ndisease   \niResponses in extra mammary Paget disease, head and neck cancer, oropharyngeal neoplasm and salivary gland cancer  \niiIHC based on central HER2 testing; 67 patients had IHC 1+ (n=25), IHC 0 (n=30) or unknown IHC status (n=12) by central testing \niiiConfirmed complete response, confirmed partial response or stable disease \n \nDESTINY- CRC02 Primary Results  \nPrimary results from the DESTINY -CRC02  phase 2 trial , which evaluated ENHERTU at the 5.4 mg/kg and \n6.4 mg/kg doses in patients with previously treated locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic HER2 \npositive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ in-situ hybridization  [ISH]+) colorectal cancer of BRAF wild -type, RAS wild -\ntype or RAS mutant tumor types, also were presented at ASCO.   Analysis of the primary endpoint showed that ENHERTU achieved a confirmed ORR of 37.8% (95% CI: \n27.3-49.2) in patients treated with the 5.4 mg/kg dose (n=82) and 27.5% (95% CI: 14.6-43.9) in patients treated with the 6.4 mg/kg dose (n=40) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). All \nresponses were partial (n=31 [5.4 mg/kg]; n=11 [6.4 mg/kg]) with 48.8% of patients in the 5.4 mg/kg arm\n4 \n and 57.5% of patients in the 6.4 mg/kg arm achieving stable disease. Greater efficacy was observed in \npatients with the highest levels of HER2 expression (IHC 3+) (46.9% ORR [95% CI : 34.3- 59.8]) compared \nto those with IHC 2+/ISH+ HER2 status in the 5.4 mg/kg treatment arm (5.6% ORR [95% CI : 0.1-27.3]). \nAntitumor efficacy was observed regardless of RAS mutation status ( 28.6%  ORR with RAS mutations; \n39.7% ORR  without RAS mutations) and in those with prior HER2 directed therapy (41.2%  ORR ) in the 5.4 \nmg/kg arm.  \n \nWith a median duration of follow -up of 8.9 months and 10.3 months in the 5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg arms \nrespectively, ENHERTU also demonstrated a median DoR of 5.5 months in both the 5.4 mg/kg (95% CI : \n4.2-8.1) and 6.4 mg/kg (95% CI : 3.7-NE) arms. Median progression- free survival (PF S) was 5.8 months \n(95% CI : 4.6-7.0) in the 5.4 mg/kg arm and 5.5 months (95% CI : 4.2-7.0) in the 6.4 mg/kg arm. Median \noverall survival (OS) was 13.4 months (95% CI : 12.5- 16.8) in the 5.4 mg/kg arm and not reached (95% CI : \n9.9-NE) in the 6.4 mg/kg arm.  \n \nThe safety profile observed in DESTINY -CRC02 at the 5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg dose levels was consistent \nwith other clinical trials of ENHERTU, with no new safety signals identified at either dose. A more favorable \nbenefit -risk profile was observed in patient s treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg resulting in its selection as \nthe recommended dose. Grade 3 or higher treatment related TEAEs were numerically higher with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg versus 5.4 mg/kg. Grade 3 or higher treatment related TEAEs occurred in 41.0% and 48.7% of patients receiving ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg, respectively. The most common grade 3 or higher TEAEs occurring in ≥10% of patients receiving ENHERTU were neutropenia (16.9% [5.4 mg/kg]; \n28.2% [6.4 mg/kg]), anemia (9.6% [5.4 mg/kg]; 23.1% [6.4 mg/kg]) and thrombocytopenia (6.0% [5.4 \nmg/kg]; 12.8% [6.4 mg/kg]). There were 12 cases  of treatment related ILD or pneumonitis reported as \ndetermined by an independent adjudication committee  (8.4% [n=7/83] in the 5.4 mg/kg arm; 12.8% [n=5/39] \nin the 6.4 mg/kg arm). The majority of ILD or pneumonitis events (8.4% [5.4 mg/kg];  10.2% [6.4 mg/kg]) \nwere low grade (grade 1 or 2) with no grade 3, no grade 4 and one grade 5 event observed (2.6% [6.4  \nmg/kg]).  \n \nThe results of DESTINY -CRC02 support 5.4 mg/kg as the optimal dose of ENHERTU monotherapy in patients \nwith HER2  positive metastatic colorectal cancer.  \n \nAbout DESTINY- PanTumor02  \nDESTINY -PanTumor02 is a global, multicenter, multi -cohort, open- label phase 2 trial evaluating the \nefficacy and safety o f ENHERTU (5.4  mg/kg) for the treatment of previously treated HER2 expressing \ntumors, including biliary tract cancer, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and other tumors. The primary efficacy endpoint of DESTINY -PanTumor02 is confirmed \nORR as assessed by investigato r. Secondary endpoints include DoR, DCR, PFS, OS , safety, tolerability and\n5 \n pharmacokinetics. DESTINY -PanTumor02 has enrolled 267 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and \nNorth America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout DESTINY- CRC02 \nDESTINY -CRC02 is a global, randomized, two arm, parallel, multicenter phase 2 trial evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of two doses (5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg) of ENHERTU in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive colorectal cancer of BRAF wild -type, or RAS wild-type and RAS \nmutant tumor types previously treated with standard therapy. The trial was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, patients (n=80) were randomized 1:1 to receive either 5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg of ENHERTU. In \nthe second stage, additional patients (n=42) were enrolled in the 5.4 mg/kg arm. The primary endpoint is confirmed ORR as assessed by BICR. Secondary endpoints include DoR, DCR, investigator- assessed \nconfirmed ORR, clinical benefit ratio, PFS, OS  and safety. DESTINY- CRC02 enrolled 122 patients at \nmultiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America. For more information about the trial, vis it \nClinicalTrials.gov . \n About HER2 Expression in Solid Tumors  \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor  growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface  of various tissue cells \nthroughout the body and is involved in normal cell growth .1,2 In some cancer s, HER2  expression is amplified \nor the cells have activating mutations.1,3 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a result of HER2  gene \namplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis.4 \n \nWhile HER2 directed therapies have been used to treat breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers, more \nresearch is needed evaluating their potential role in treati ng other HER2 expressing tumor types.2,5,6 \n \nHER2 is an emerging biomarker in biliary tract, bladder, cervical, endometrial, ovarian  and pancreatic \ncancers.3 Testing is not routinely performed in these additional tumor types and as a result, available \nliterature is limited. HER2 overexpression (IHC 3+) has been observed at rates from 1 % to 28 % in these \nsolid tumors .7, 8 There is an unmet need for effective th erapies for certain HER2 expressing solid tumors, \nparticularly for those who have progressed on  or are refractory to  standard of care therapies as t here are \ncurrently no approved HER2 directed therapies for these cancers.2,9 \n \nColorectal cancer is the third most common and second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide \nwith more than 1.9 million patients diagnosed  and more than 935,000 deaths globally in 2020.10 \nApproximately 25% of patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis, meaning the disease has spread to \ndistant organs and about 50% of patients with colorectal cancer will eventually develop metastases.11 For \npatients with metastatic disease, approximately 2% to 3% are HER2 overexpressing.6,12\n6 \n About ENHERTU   \nENHERTU  (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU  is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU  consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor \npayload, an exatecan derivative, via  a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 50 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior  anti-\nHER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have  \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy based on the results from  \nthe DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 40 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ in-situ hybridization (ISH) -) breast cancer who \nhave received a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from  the DESTINY -Breast04  \ntrial. \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Israel and under accelerated approval in the U.S . for the treatment of \nadult patients  with unresectable or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) whose tumors have \nactivating HER2  (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected by an FDA -approved test, and who have received a prior \nsystemic therapy  based on the results from the DESTINY -Lung02 trial. Co ntinued approval in the U.S. for \nthis indication may be  contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n ENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastri c01 and/or \nDESTINY -Gastric02  trials.  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU  Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers.  Trials in combination with other anticancer \ntreatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.\n7 \n About the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU  in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is respo nsible for the \nmanufacturing and supply of ENHERTU  and datopotamab deruxtecan. \n About the DXd ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe DXd ADC portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo currently consists of five ADCs in clinical development across multiple types of cancer. The company’s clinical trial stage DXd ADCs include ENHERTU, a HER2  directed \nADC , and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being jointly developed \nand commercialized globally with AstraZeneca; and patritumab  deruxtecan  (HER3 -DXd), a  HER3 directed \nADC. Two additional ADCs including ifinatamab deruxtecan (I- DXd; DS -7300), a B7- H3 directed ADC, and \nraludot atug deruxtecan (R- DXd; DS -6000), a CDH6 directed ADC, are being developed through a strategic \nearly -stage  research col laboration with Sarah Cannon Research Institute. \n Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, each ADC  target s and deliver s a cytotoxic \npayload inside cancer cells that express a specific cell surface antigen. Each ADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide- based cleavable linkers.  \n Datopotamab deruxtecan, ifinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan and raludota tug deruxtecan are \ninvestigational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy \nhave not been established.  \n \nENHERTU U.S. Important Safety Information  \n \nIndications  \n \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based \nregimen either:  \n– In the metastat ic setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six \nmonths of completing therapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH- ) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA-\napproved test, who have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease \nrecurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy\n8 \n • Unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors h ave activating HER2 \n(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test, and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY  \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \nWarnings and Precautions \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resol ved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomat ic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.   \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, ILD \noccurred in 12% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 1.0% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 5  months (range: 0.9 to 23). \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8  months (range: \n1.2 to  21). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with E NHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 10\n9/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, th en maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt\n9 \n ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC \n<1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a \ndecrease in neut rophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Sixteen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased \nneutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 days (range: 2  to 664). \nFebrile neutropenia was reported in 1.1% of patients.  \n \nLocall y Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty- one percen t had \nGrade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment \nwithin 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40- 45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from \nbaseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is \n>20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF asse ssment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU \nhas not been stud ied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to \ninitiation of treatment.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with  ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \nLVEF decrease was reported in 3.6% of patients, of which 0.4% were Grade 3. \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated w ith \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and f or \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by one level.\n10 \n  \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in 984 \npatients in Study DS8201-A-J101 (NCT0256490 0), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -\nBreast04, and DESTINY -Lung02. Among these patients 65% were exposed for >6 months and 39% were \nexposed for >1 year. In this pooled safety population, the most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including \nlabora tory abnormalities, were nausea (76%), decreased white blood cell count (71%), decreased hemoglobin \n(66%), decreased neutrophil count (65%), decreased lymphocyte count (55%), fatigue (54%), decreased \nplatelet count (47%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (48%), vomiting (44%), increased alanine \naminotransferase (42%), alopecia (39%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (39%), constipation (34%), \nmusculoskeletal pain (32%), decreased appetite (32%), hypokalemia (28%), diarrhea (28%), and respiratory \ninfection (24%).  \n \nHER2 -Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nDESTINY-Breast03 \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 257 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast \ncancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every t hree weeks in \nDESTINY -Breast03. The median duration of treatment was 14 months (range: 0.7 to 30). \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 19% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were vomiting, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, pyrexia, and \nurinary tract infection. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients including COVID-19 and sudden death (one patient each). \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 14% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis accounted for 8%. \nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, \nthromboc ytopenia, pneumonia, nausea, fatigue, and ILD/pneumonitis. Dose reductions occurred in 21% of \npatients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction \nwere nausea, neutropenia, and fatigue. \n \nThe most common (≥ 20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (76%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (70%), increased aspartate \naminotransferase (67%), decreased hemoglobin (64%), decreased lymphocyte count (55% ), increased alanine \naminotransferase (53%), decreased platelet count (52%), fatigue (49%), vomiting (49%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (49%), alopecia (37%), hypokalemia (35%), constipation (34%), musculoskeletal pain \n(31%), diarrhea (29%), decreased appetite (29%), respiratory infection (22%), headache (22%), abdominal pain (21%), increased blood bilirubin (20%), and stomatitis (20%). \n \nHER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nDESTINY-Breast04  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 371 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ \nor IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \nDESTINY -Breast04. The median duration of treatment was 8 months (range: 0.2 to  33) for patients who \nreceived ENHERTU.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 28% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were ILD/pneumonitis, pneumonia, dyspnea, musculoskeletal \npain, sepsis, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypercalcemia, nausea, pyrexia, and vomiting. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4% of patients including ILD/pneumonitis (3 patients); sepsis (2 patients); and \nischemic colitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, dyspnea, febrile neutropenia, general physical \nhealth deterioration, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure (1 patient each).\n11 \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 16% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis accounted for 8%. \nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 39% of pat ients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, fatigue, anemia, leukopenia, COVID-19, ILD/pneumonitis, increased transaminases, and hyperbilirubinemia. Dose reductions \noccurred in 2 3% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nause a (76%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (70%), decreased hemoglobin (64%), decreased neutrophil count (64%), decreased lymphocyte count (55%), fatigue (54%), decreased platelet count (44%), alopecia (40%), vomiting \n(40%), increased aspartate aminotransfe rase (38%), increased alanine aminotransferase (36%), constipation \n(34%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (34%), decreased appetite (32%), musculoskeletal pain (32%), \ndiarrhea (27%), and hypokalemia (25%). \n \nUnresectable or Metastatic HER2 -Mutant NSCLC  (5.4 mg/kg) \nDESTINY -Lung02 evaluated two dose levels (5.4 mg/kg [n=101] and 6.4 mg/kg [n=50]); however, only the \nresults for the recommended dose of 5.4  mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks are described below due to \nincreased toxicity observed with the higher dose in patients with NSCLC, including ILD/pneumonitis. \n \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 101 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -mutant \nNSCLC who received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every three weeks in DESTINY-Lung02. \nNineteen percent of patients were exposed for >6 months.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were ILD/pneumonitis, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, nausea, \npleural effusi on, and increased troponin I. Fatality occurred in 1 patient with suspected ILD/pneumonitis \n(1%).  \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 8% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent \ndiscontinuation of ENHERTU were ILD/pneumonitis, diarrh ea, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, \nmyocarditis, and vomiting. Dose interruptions of ENHERTU due to adverse reactions occurred in 23% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose interruption (>2%) included neutropenia and \nILD/pneumonitis. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 11% of patients.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (61%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (60%), decreased hemoglobin (58%), decreased neutrophil count (52%), \ndecreased lymphocyte count (43%), decreased platelet count (40%), decreased albumin (39%), increased \naspartate aminotransferase (35%), increased alanine aminotransferase (34%), fatigue (32%), constipation (31%), decreased appetite (30%), vomiting (26%), increased alkaline phosphatase (22%), and alopecia \n(21%).   \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in D ESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly or \npaclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 m onths (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) for patients who received ENHERTU. \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in  \n2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred in one patient each ( 0.8%).\n12 \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose int erruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased hemoglobin \n(75%), decreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (72%), decreased lymphocyte count \n(70%), decreased platelet count (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), increased aspartate \naminotransferase (58%), fatigue (55%), increased bl ood alkaline phosphatase (54%), increased alanine \naminotransferase (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), increased blood bilirubin (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%). \n \nUse in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a \nbreastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female  partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHE RTU have not been established in pediatric patients. \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 883 patients with breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 \nyears and 3.6% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade \n3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (60%) as compared to younger patients (48%). \nOf the 101 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU \n5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety \nwere observed between patients ≥65  years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with \nlocally advance d or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU \n6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences \nin efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compare d to younger patients. \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU ha s not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomera se inhibitor. The recommended dosage of    \nENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times \nULN and any AST). \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.\n13 \n Please see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our world -\nclass science and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the \nworld.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular disease, Daiichi Sankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as well as other diseases with high unmet medical needs.

A median progression -free survival (PFS) of 9.9 months (95% CI: 9.0- 11.3) was seen \nwith ENHERTU versus 5.1 months (95% CI: 4.2-6.8) in those treated with chemotherapy as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). A 36% reduction in the risk of death ( HR =  0.64; 95% CI: 0.49-\n0.84; p=0.001) also was seen with ENHERTU compared to chemotherapy. ENHERTU was granted priority review in 2022 by the Japan MHLW for this tumor type based on these data.  \n“For the first time , certain patients in Japan  whose tumors have a low HER2 expression  have a treatment \noption available targeted specifically for them ,” said Wataru  Takasaki, PhD, Executive Officer, Head of \nR&D Division in Japan, Daiichi Sankyo. “ This is the  third indication approved within  three years in Japan \nfor ENHERTU  for patients with breast cancer and  this medicine  has the potential to  become standard of care  \nfor patients  with low HER2 expression.”\n2 \n In DESTINY -Breast04, the safety profile of ENHERTU was consistent with previous clinical trials with no \nnew safety concerns identified. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 357 patients (96.2%) treated with \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg). The most common AEs were nausea (73.0%), fatigue (47.7%), alopecia (37.7%), vomiting (34.0%), anemia (33.2%) and decreased neutrophil count (33.2%). In Japanese patients, interstitial lung disease ( ILD) occurred in 26.8% of patients.  \n \nENHERTU is approved in Japan with a Warning for ILD. As cases of ILD, including fatal cases, have \noccurred in ENHERTU -treated patients, ENHERTU is to be used in close collaboration with a respiratory \ndisease expert. Closely observe patients during therapy by monitoring for early signs or symptoms of ILD (such as dyspnea, cough or fever) and regularly perform peripheral artery oxygen saturation (SpO\n2) tests, \nchest X -ray scans and chest CT scans. If abnormalities are observed, discontinue administration of \nENHERTU and take appropriate measures such as corticosteroid administration. Prior to initiation of ENHERTU therapy, perform a chest CT scan and interview to confirm the absence of any comorbidity or history of ILD with the patient and carefully consider the eligibility of the patient for ENHERTU therapy.\n \n The efficacy and safety of ENHERTU as a neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy for  the treatment of HER2  low \nunresectable or recurrent breast cancer has not been established. ENHERTU should be administered only to patients who have been confirmed to have low HER2 e xpression based on approved in vitro diagnostics or \nmedical devices performed at testing facilities or by pathologists with sufficient experience.  \n About DESTINY- Breast04  \nDESTINY -Breast04 is a global, randomized, open- label, pivotal phase 3 trial evaluatin g the efficacy and  \nsafety of ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) versus physician’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin,  \ngemcitabine, paclitaxel or nab -paclitaxel) in patients with HR positive or HR negative, HER2 low  \nunresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with one or two prior lines of chemotherapy. \nPatients were randomized 2:1 to receive either ENHERTU  or chemotherapy.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY -Breast04 is PFS in patients with HR positive disease based on BICR.  \nKey secondar y endpoints include PFS based on BICR in all randomized patients (HR positive and HR  \nnegative disease), overall survival ( OS) in patients with HR positive disease and OS in all randomized \npatients (HR positive and HR negative disease). Other secondary endpoints include PFS based on \ninvestigator assessment,  objective response rate based on BICR and on investigator assessment, duration of \nresponse based on BICR  and safety. DESTINY -Breast04 enrolled 557 patients at multiple sites in Asia, \nEurope and North Amer ica. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov .\n3 \n About Breast Cancer and HER2 Expression  \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.2 More than two million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020 with nearly 685,000 \ndeaths globally.2 In Japan, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women.1 Approximately 92,000 cases  \nof breast cancer were diagnosed in Japan in 2020, with approximately 17,000 deaths.1 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of  \ntumors , including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers, and is one of many biomarkers expressed in \nbreast cancer tumors .3 \n \nHER2 expression is determined by an immunohistochemistry ( IHC) test, which estimates the amount of \nHER2 protein on a  cancer cell, a nd/or an in -situ hybridization ( ISH) test, which counts the copies of the \nHER2  gene in cancer cells.3,4 HER2 tests  provide IHC and ISH scores across the full HER2 spectrum and are \nroutinely used to determine appropriate  treatment options for patients with  metastatic breast cancer. HER2 \npositive cancers are currently defined as HER2 expression measured as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+, and HER2 negative cancers are defined as HER2 expression measured as IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -.\n3  \nHowever, approximately half of all breast cancers are HER2 low, defined as a HER2 score of IHC 1+ or  \nIHC 2+  /ISH-.5,6,7 HER2 low occurs in both HR positive and HR negative disease.8  \n About ENHERTU   \nENHERTU  (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU  is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU  consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor \npayload, an exatecan derivative, via  a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 40 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior  anti-\nHER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have  \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy based on the results from  \nthe DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior \nsystemic therap y in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results of the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.\n4 \n  \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved under accelerated approval in the U.S . for the treatment of adult patients  \nwith unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2  \n(ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected by an FDA -approve d test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy  \nbased on the results from the DESTINY -Lung02 trial. Continued approval for this indication may be  \ncontingent upon verification and descri ption of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n ENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  and/or \nDESTINY -Gastric02  trials.  \n About the ENHERTU  Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underwa y evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers.  \nTrials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU  in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is respo nsible for the \nmanufacturing and supply of ENHERTU  and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nAbout the DXd ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe DXd  ADC portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo currently consists of five ADCs in clinical development across  \nmultiple types of cancer. The company’s clinical trial stage DXd ADCs include ENHERTU, a HER2  directed \nADC , and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato- DXd), a TROP2 direc ted ADC, which are being jointly  developed \nand commercialized globally with AstraZeneca; and, patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a  HER3 directed \nADC. Two additional ADCs including ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd; DS -7300), a B7- H3 directed ADC, and \nDS-6000, a CDH6 directed ADC, are being developed through a strategic early- stage  research collaboration \nwith Sarah Cannon Research Institute.  \n Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, each ADC  target s and deliver s a cytotoxic \npayload inside ca ncer cells that express a specific cell surface antigen. Each ADC consists of a monoclonal \nantibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via \ntetrapeptide- based cleavable linkers.\n5 \n  \nDatopotamab deruxtecan, ifinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan and DS -6000 are investigational  \nmedicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.  \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our  world -\nclass science and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the \nworld.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and ca rdiovascular disease, Daiichi  \nSankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as well as other diseases  \nwith high unmet medical needs.

These data were presented during the Presidential Session on March 16, 2023 .  \n \nAn objective response rate ( ORR ) of 40.2% (95% CI: 30.6-50.4) , as assessed by blinded independent central \nreview (BICR) , was observed with patritumab deruxtecan  in the pooled analysis of 102 patients with EGFR -\nmutat ed NSCLC . One complete response (CR) , 40 partial response s (PRs) and 39 cases of  stable diseas e \n(SD)  were seen. A disease control rate (DCR) of 78.4%  (95% CI: 69.2-86.0) and a median duration of \nresponse (DOR ) of 7.6 months  (95% CI: 6.9-14.7) were  observed . Median progression -free survival (PFS) \nwas 6.4 months  (95%  CI: 5.3-8.3) and m edian overall survival ( OS) was 15.8 mo nths (95% CI : 10.8-21.5) . \nEfficacy outcomes were consistent in a subgroup of 78 patients previously treated with  third -generation  \nEGFR TKI and platinum -based chemotherapy . \n \nResponses with patritumab deruxtecan were seen in patients across a broad range of HER3 expression and  \nacross multiple mechani sms of EGFR TKI resistance . Additionally, c onfirmed  ORR s of 36 .4% (95% CI: \n23.8-50.4) and 4 4.7% (95% CI: 30.2 -59.9) were observed in p atients with a nd without a  history of central \nnervous system  (CNS)  metastases , respectively.  \n \n“Patritumab deruxtecan  demonstrated a median overall survival  of more than 15 months, which is \nparticularly impressive  in heavily pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic E GFR-mutated \nnon-small cell lung cancer,” said Hidetoshi Hayashi,  MD, PhD,  Associate Professor, Department of Medical \nOncology at  Kindai University, Osaka, Japan . “Further clinical evaluation  of patri tumab deruxtecan in \nEGFR -mutated NSCLC is underway .”  \n \nPatients were heavily pre -treated receiving a median of four prior lines of systemic therapy in the locally \nadvanced/metastatic setting (range, 1 -14) and m edian treatment duration was 5.5 months (range, 0.7 -27.5). \nSafety of patritumab deruxtecan seen in this phase 1 trial was consistent with that previously observed in \npatients with EGFR -mutated NSCLC. Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  grade ≥ 3 were  reported  \nin 58 patients  (56.9%) and included platelet count decrease  (26%) , neutrophil count decrease  (21%) , fatigue  \n(10%) , anemia  (9%) , white blood cell count decrease  (8%) , nausea  (7%) , hypokalemia  (7%) , lymphocyte \ncount decrease  (7%) , dyspnea  (6%)  and febrile neutropenia  (6%) . Eight  patients ( 7.8%) had confirmed \ntreatment -related interstitial lung disease (ILD)  as determined  by independent adjudication  committee . The \nmajority  of these ILD events were low -grade with two grade 1 , three grade 2, one grade 3  and two grade 5 \nevents .

These data were presented during a second Presidential Session on March 17, 2023.  \n \nIn patients with HR positive breast cancer, confirmed ORR s of 36.2% (95%, CI: 24.0 -49.9) in patients with \nHER2 low (n=58) and 28.2% (95% CI: 15.0 -44.9) in patients with HER2 zero  (n=39)  disease were observed . \nMedian DOR was 7.2 months (95% CI: 5.5 -NE) and 7.0 months (95% CI: 3.0 -NE), median PFS was 5.8 \nmonths (95 % CI: 4.1 -8.5) and 8.2 months (95% CI: 5.8 -9.1) and median OS was 13.7 months (95% CI: 8.5 -\n20.1) and 14.6 months (95% CI: 11.0 -21.0) in the HER2 low and HER2 zero subgroups, respectively.    \n \nIn patients with TNBC, a confirmed ORR of 20.7% ( 95% CI: 8.0 -39.7)  was observed  in patients with HER2  \nlow expression (n=29)  and 26.3% ( 95%, CI: 9.1-51.2) in patients with  HER2  zero expression (n=19) . Median \nDOR was 4.1 mo nths (95% CI: 2.7 -6.0) and 8.4 mo nths (95% CI: 4.2 -NE), median PFS was 4.4 mo nths \n(95% CI : 2.6-5.6) and 8.4 mo nths (95% CI : 3.9-13.9) , and OS was 12.7 months (95% CI: 9.2 -21.8) and 16.6 \nmonths (95% CI: 9.3 -23.8) in the HER2 low and HER2 zero subgroups, respectively.  \n \nPooled safety of patritumab deruxtecan previously reported was further analyzed by dose  (4.8 mg/kg and 6.4 \nmg/kg) and location of patients in Japan (n=142) or the U.S. (n=40) with an overall  similar rate for TEAEs , \nexcluding ILD,  seen between Japan and U.S. subgroups. Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs occurred in 99 patients (69.7%)\n4 \n in Japan and 21 patients (52.5%) in the U.S. Twelve patients (8.5%) from Japan and zero patients from U.S. \nhad confirmed treatment related ILD as determined by an indepe ndent adjudication committee. The majority \nof ILD events were low -grade with three grade 1 (2.1%), five grade 2 (3.5%), three grade 3 (2.1%) and one \ngrade 5 (0.7%) event.  \n \n“These data extend previous observations and demonstrate patritumab deruxtecan has shown clinical activity \nin patients with metastatic breast cancer  and HER2  low or HER2  zero expression ,” said Hiroji Iwata, MD, \nPhD, Vice Director and Chief of Breast Oncology, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya, Japa n. “These \ndata support the furthe r evaluation  of patritumab deruxtecan  as a potential treatment option for breast cancer \nand learning more about appropriate sequencing approaches with other  therapies .”  \n \nPatients across subgroups were heavily pre -treated , receiving a median of seven prior lines of systemic \ntherapy in the HR positive , HER2 l ow and H ER2 zer o subgroups , four prior lines of systemic therapy in the \nHR negative, HER2 low  subgroup , and three prior lines of systemic therapy in the HR negative, HER 2 zero  \nsubgroup . Median treatment duration was 5.5 months (range, 0.7 -28.4) in the HR positive, HER2 low \nsubgroup , 7.6 months (range, 1.4-22.8) in the HR positive , HER2 zero subgroup , 4.9 months (range, 0.7 -\n19.8)  in the HR negative, HER2 low subgroup  and 5.7 months (range, 0.7 -22.5) in the  HR negative, HER2 \nzero subgroup . As of data cut -off of August 16, 2021 , four patients (10.6%)  remained on treatment with \npatritumab deruxtecan . \n \nSummary of  HER2 Expression Sub group Analysis  in HER3 Expressing Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nPhase 1/2  Trial  \n \n HR positive /HER2  negative  TNBC  \nEfficacy \nMeasure  HR positive  \n/HER2 low  \n(n=58)  HR positive/  \nHER2  zero  \n(n=39)  HR negative \n/HER2 low  \n(n=29)  HR negative / \nHER2  zero  \n(n=19)  \nConfirmed ORR, \n% (95% CI)  36.2% (24.0 -49.9)  28.2% (15.0 -44.9)  20.7% (8.0 -39.7)  26.3% (9.1 -51.2)  \nConfirmed BOR  \n     PR, %  36.2%  28.2%  20.7%  26.3%  \n     SD, %  43.1%  61.5%  48.3%  68.4%  \n     PD, %  10.3%  7.7%  24.1%  5.3%  \n     NE, % (n)  10.3%  2.6%  6.9%  0.0%  \nDOR, median \n(95% CI), months  7.2 months  \n(5.5-NE) 7.0 months  \n(3.0-NE) 4.1 months  \n(2.7-6.0) 8.4 months  \n(4.2-NE) \nPFS, median \n(95% CI) , months  5.8 months  \n(4.1-8.5) 8.2 months  \n(5.8-9.1) 4.4 months  \n(2.6-5.6) 8.4 months  \n(3.9-13.9)  \nOS, median  \n(95% CI), months  13.7 months  \n(8.5-20.1) 14.6 months  \n(11.0 -21.0)  12.7 months  \n(9.2-21.8)  16.6 months  \n(9.3-23.8)\n5 \n BOR, best overall response; DOR, duration of response; HER, human epidermal growth factor receptor; HR, hormone receptor; \nORR, objective response rate; OS, overall survival; PD, progressive disease; PFS, progression -free survival; PR, partial response; \nSD, stable disease; NE, not evaluable; TNBC, triple negative breast cancer.  \n95% exact binomial confidence interval (by Clopper -Pearson method ) \n \nAbout the Phase 1 Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer Trial   \nThe global, multicenter, open label, two -part phase 1 trial is evaluating patritumab deruxtecan in previously \ntreated patients with metastatic or unresectable NSCLC.  \n \nThe dose escalation part of the trial is evaluating patients with EGFR -mutated disease either with progression \non osimertinib or T790M -negative  after progression on erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib. The primary objective \nof this part of the trial was to assess the safety and tolerability of patritumab deruxtecan and determine the \nrecommended dose for expansion (RDE).  \n \nThe dose expansion part of the trial is evaluating patritumab deruxtecan at the RDE (5.6 mg/kg every three \nweeks) in three cohorts. Cohort 1 includes patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR -mutated \nNSCLC who experienced disease progression after taking one or more EGFR TKI s and one or more \nplatinum -based chemotherapy regimens. Cohort 2 includes patients with squamous or non -squamous \nNSCLC without EGFR -activating mutations  following platinum -based chemotherapy and following an anti -\nPD-1 or anti -PD-L1 antibody regimen. Cohort  3 includes patients with NSCLC with EGFR -activating \nmutations including any histology other than combined small cell and non -small cell lung cancer; patients in \nCohort 3 are randomized 1:1 to receive the 5.6 mg/kg RDE regimen (Cohort 3a) or an escalating up-titration \nregimen of patritumab deruxtecan (Cohort 3b). Cohort 4 includes patients with NSCLC, including any \nhistology other than small cell or combined small and non -small c ell. \n \nThe primary objective of Cohorts 1 , 2 and  3 in the dose expansion part of  the trial is to assess efficacy of \npatritumab deruxtecan as measured by confirmed ORR assessed by BICR . Secondary trial endpoints include \ninvestigator -assessed ORR, DCR, DOR, PFS, OS, safety and pharmacokinetics. The primary objective of \nCohort 4 is to as sess the relative bioavailability of clinical study versus commercial patr itumab deruxtecan in \nCohort 3a . The trial enrolled 264 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America. For more \ninformation, visit  ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout the Phase 1/2 Breast Cancer Trial  \nThe global, open -label, three -part phase 1/2 trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of patritumab \nderuxte can in patients with HER3 expressing advanced/unresectable metastatic breast cancer who are \nrefractory or intolerant to standard treatment, or for whom no standard treatment is available.\n6 \n The dose escalation part of the trial assessed  the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of patritumab \nderuxtecan to determine the maximum tolerated dose. The dose finding part of the trial assessed the safety \nand efficacy of patritumab deruxtecan at  selected dosing levels to determine the recommended dose for \nexpansion. Patients in the dose escalation and dose finding parts of the trial must have received six or fewer \nprior chemotherapy regimens, at least two of which were administered for treatment of advanced/  \nunresectable metastatic disease, and at least one prior chemotherapeutic regimen must have included a \ntaxane, administered in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or advanced setting , except in the dose expan sion part of \nthe TNBC cohort.  \n \nThe phase 2 par t of the trial evaluat ed the safety and efficacy of patritumab deruxtecan at the recommended \ndose for expansion in four different cohorts of patients with HER3 expressing and HER2 negative locally \nadvanced or metastatic breast cancer, including HR positive  and triple negative breast cancer.  The trial \nenrolled 18 2 patients at multiple sites in the United States and Japan.

Targeted therapy with EGFR TKIs offer s higher response rates and \nprogression -free survival compared to chemotherapy.6 However, disease progression from resistance to \nEGFR TKIs inevitably occurs one to two years following initial treatment.9 Subsequent standard treatments \nfollowing firs t-line progression offer limited efficacy.10 New treatment approaches are needed to help \nimprove survival in patients with EGFR -mutated NSCLC.  \n \nAbout Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.11  More than two million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020 with nearly 685,000 \ndeaths globally  2,11 Despite recent advancements across the three main subtypes of breast cancer, including \nHER2 positive, HR positive/HER2 low or negative and trip le negative , it remains incurable and new \ntreatment strategies are needed  for refractory disease .\n7 \n About HER3  \nHER3 is a member of the EGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases.12 It is estimated that about 83% of \nprimary NSCLC tumors express HER3  and 90% of advanced EGFR -mutated tumors after prior EGFR TKI \ntreatment express HER3 .5,13 HER3 also is highly expressed in about  30% to 50% of breast tumor s.3,4,14 There \nis currently no HER3 directed medicine approved for the treatment of any cancer.  \n \nAbout Patritumab Deruxtecan  \nPatritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd) is an investigational HER3 directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi \nSankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, patritumab deruxtecan is composed of a fully human anti -HER3 \nIgG1 monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisom erase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan \nderivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n \nPatritumab deruxtecan was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) in December 2021 for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced \nEGFR -mutated NSCLC with disease progression on or after treatment with a third generation TKI and \nplatinum -based therapies.  \n \nPatritumab deruxtecan is currently being evaluated as both a monotherapy and in co mbination with other \ntherapies in a global development program, which includes  HERTHENA -Lung01 , a phase 2  trial in patients \nwith EGFR -mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC  previously tr eated with two prior systemic \ntherapies  including at least one EGFR TKI and a t least one platinu m-based  chemotherapy based regimen ; \nHERTHENA Lung02 , a phase 3 trial versus platinum -based chemotherapy in patients with EGFR -mutated \nlocally advanced or metastatic NSCLC following treatment with one or more EGFR TKIs; a phase 1 trial  in \ncombi nation with osimertinib in EGFR -mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC; and a phase 1 trial  \nin previously treated patients with unresectable or metastatic NSCLC. A phase 1/2 trial  in HER3 expressing \nmetastatic breast cancer also has been completed.  \n \nAbout the DXd ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe DXd ADC portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo currently consists of five ADCs in clinical development across \nmultiple types of cancer. The company’s clinical trial stage DXd ADCs include ENHERTU, a HER2 \ndirected ADC and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd), a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being jointly \ndeveloped and commercialized globall y with AstraZeneca; and patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a \nHER3 directed ADC. Two additional ADCs including ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd; DS -7300), a B7 -H3 \ndirected ADC, and DS -6000, a CDH6 directed ADC, are being developed through a strategic early -stage  \nresearch collaboration with Sarah Cannon Research Institute.\n8 \n Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology to target and deliver a cytotoxic payload \ninside cancer cells that express a specific cell surface antigen, each ADC consists of a monoclonal antibody \nattached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -\nbased cleavable linkers.  \n \nDatopotamab deruxtecan, ifinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan and DS -6000 are investigational \nmedicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been \nestablished.  \n \nAbout  Daiichi  Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our world -\nclass science  and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the \nworld.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular disease, Daiichi \nSankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapie s for people with cancer as well as other diseases \nwith high unmet medical need.

For \nmore information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout ENHERTU   \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU  is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor \npayload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in mor e than 40 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior  anti-\n3 \n HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setti ng, and have  \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy based on the results from  \nthe DESTINY- Breast03  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 low (immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+ or IHC 2+/ in-situ hybridization \n(ISH)- ) breast cancer who have received a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed \ndisease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results \nfrom  the DESTINY- Breast04  trial.  \n ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved under accelerated approval in the U.S . for the treatment of adult patients  \nwith unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2  \n(ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected by an FDA -approve d test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy \nbased on the results from the DESTINY- Lung02 trial. Continued approval for this indication may be  \ncontingent upon verification and descri ption of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY- Gastric01  and/or \nDESTINY- Gastric02  trials.  \n About the ENHERTU  Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers.  Trials in combination with other anticancer \ntreatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nAbout the DXd ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe DXd ADC portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo currently consists of five ADCs in clinical development across  \nmultiple types of cancer. The company’s clinical trial stage DXd ADCs include ENHERTU, a HER2  directed\n4 \n ADC and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato- DXd), a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being jointly developed \nand commercialized globally with AstraZeneca; and patritumab  deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a  HER3 directed \nADC. Two additional ADCs  including ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd; DS -7300), a B7- H3 directed ADC, and \nDS-6000, a CDH6 directed ADC, are being developed through a strategic early- stage  research collaboration \nwith Sarah Cannon Research Institute.  \n \nDesigned using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, each ADC  target s and deliver s a cytotoxic \npayload inside cancer cells that express a specific cell surface antigen. Each ADC consists of a monoclonal \nantibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exate can derivative,  DXd) via \ntetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n Datopotamab deruxtecan, ifinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan and DS -6000 are investigational  \nmedicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been \nestablished.  \n \nENHERTU U.S. Important Safety Information  \n Indications  \n \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based \nregimen either:  \n– In the metastat ic setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six \nmonths of completing therapy \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -\napproved test,  who have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease \nrecurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2  \n(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA -approved test, and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen\n5 \n  \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n Contraindications None.  \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater),  permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.   \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, ILD \noccurred in 12% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 1.0% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 5  months (range: 0.9 to 23). \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: \n1.2 to 21). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor complete blood counts  prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 10\n9/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC \n<1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU un til resolved, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a \ndecrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Sixteen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased\n6 \n neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 days (range: 2 to 664). \nFebrile neutropenia was reported in 1.1% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty- one percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF  assessment \nwithin 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40- 45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10- 20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from \nbaseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume \ntreatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU \nhas not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to \ninitiation of treatment.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \nLVEF decrease was reported in 3.6% of patients, of whi ch 0.4% were Grade 3. \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade  2 decrease in LVEF.  \n Embryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with fema le partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by one level.\n7 \n Adverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in 984 \npatients in Study DS8201-A- J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -\nBreast04, and DESTINY -Lung02.

Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients including COVID -19 \nand sudden death (one patient each).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 14% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis accounted for 8%. \nDose inter ruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, pneumonia, nausea, fatigue, and ILD/pneumonitis. Dose reductions occurred in 21% of \npatients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction \nwere nausea, neutropenia, and fatigue.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnor malities, were nausea (76%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (70%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (67%), decreased hemoglobin (64%), decreased lymphocyte count (55%), increased alanine \naminotransferase (53%), decreased platelet count (52%), fatigue (49%), vomiting (49%), increased blood \nalkaline phosphatase (49%), alopecia (37%), hypokalemia (35%), constipation (34%), musculoskeletal pain (31%), diarrhea (29%), decreased appetite (29%), respiratory infection (22%), headache (22%), abdominal pain (21%), increased blood bilirubin (20%), and stomatitis (20%).  \n \nHER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nDESTINY -Breast04  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 371 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ \nor IHC 2+/ ISH-) breast cancer who received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \nDESTINY- Breast04. The median duration of treatment was 8 months (range: 0.2 to 33) for patients who \nreceived ENHERTU.  \n Serious adverse reactions occurred in 28% of patients r eceiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were ILD/pneumonitis, pneumonia, dyspnea, musculoskeletal pain, sepsis, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypercalcemia, nausea, pyrexia, and vomiting.

The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, fatigue, anemia, \nleukopenia, COVID -19, ILD/pneumonitis, increased transaminases, and hyperbilirubinemia. Dose reductions \noccurred in 23% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most freque nt adverse reactions (>2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (76%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (70%), decreased hemoglobin (64%), decreased neutrophil count (64%), decreased lymphocyte count (55%), fatigue (54%), decreased platelet count (44%), alopecia (40%), vomiting (40%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (38%), increased alanine aminotransferase (36%) , constipation \n(34%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (34%), decreased appetite (32%), musculoskeletal pain (32%), diarrhea (27%), and hypokalemia (25%).  \n \nUnresectable or Metastatic HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nDESTINY- Lung02 evaluated two dose levels (5.4  mg/kg [n=101] and 6.4 mg/kg [n=50]); however, only the \nresults for the recommended dose of 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks are described below due to \nincreased toxicity observed with the higher dose in patients with NSCLC, including ILD/pneumonitis. \n \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 101 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -mutant \nNSCLC who received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every three weeks in DESTINY -Lung02. \nNineteen percent of patients were exposed for >6 months.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients receiving ENHERTU.

Fatality occurred in 1 patient with suspected ILD/pneumonitis \n(1%).  \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 8% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent \ndiscontinuation of ENHERTU were  ILD/pneumonitis, diarrhea, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, \nmyocarditis, a nd vomiting. Dose interruptions of ENHERTU due to adverse reactions occurred in 23% of \npatients. Adverse reactions which required dose interruption (>2%) included neutropenia and \nILD/pneumonitis. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 11% of patients.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (61%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (60%), decreased hemoglobin (58%), decreased neutrophil count (52%), decreased lymphocyte count (43%), decreased platelet count (40%), decreased albumin (39%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (35%), increased alanine aminotransferase (34%), fatigue (32%), constipation (31%), decreased appetite (30%), vomiting (26%), increased alkaline phosphatase (22%), and alopecia \n(21%).   \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in DESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly or \npaclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to 22.3) for patients who rec eived ENHERTU.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse reactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage.

Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 883 patients with breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 \nyears and 3.6% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy withi n clinical studies were observed \nbetween patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (60%) as compared to younger patients (48%). \nOf the 101 patient s with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU \n5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety \nwere observed between patients ≥65  years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU \n6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences \nin efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The  \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor. The recommended dosage of\n10 \n ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times \nULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi San kyo, Inc. at 1-877-437- 7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800- FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n  Please see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  Daiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our  world -\nclass science and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the \nworld.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular disease, Daiichi \nSankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as well as other diseases  \nwith high unmet medical needs.

The median progression- free \nsurvival (PFS) for patients treated with ENHERTU was not reached (95% CI: 18.5- NE) compared to 6.8 \nmonths for T -DM1 (95% CI: 5.6- 8.2) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR).  ENHERTU \nwas granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation and priority review in 2022 by the China NMPA for this \ntumor type based on these data.\n2 \n “This approval marks an important day for the breast cancer community in China as patients with HER2 \npositive metastatic breast cancer continue to need additional  treatment options, ” said Binghe  Xu, MD, \nProfessor and Director of the Department of Medical Onco logy, Cancer Hospital and Institute Cancer  \n \nHospital , Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. “ Despite initial treatment, patients with HER2 positive \nmetastatic breast cancer will often experience disease progression , demonstrating the importance of early \nsystemic disease control and the potential for ENHERTU to help eligible patients  with metastatic breast \ncancer.”  \n \nAdditional results from the DESTINY -Breast03 phase 3 trial showed that confirmed objective response rat e \n(ORR) was more than doubled in the ENHERTU arm ( 79.7%; n=208; 95% CI: 74. 3-84.4) versus the T -DM1 \narm (3 4.2%; n= 90; 95% CI: 28. 5-40.3). Complete responses (CR) were observed in 16.1% (n=42) of patients \nand partial responses (PR) were observed in 63.6% ( n=166) of patients treated with ENHERTU compared to \n8.7%  (n=23) achieving CR and 25.5%  (n=67) achieving PR in patients treated with T -DM1. In addition, in \nthe secondary endpoint analysis of PFS as assessed by investigator, patients treated with ENHERTU had a \nmedian PFS of 25.1 months (95% CI: 22.1- NE) compared to 7.2 months (95% CI: 6.8- 8.3) for T -DM1 \n(HR=0.26; 95% CI: 0.20- 0.35). Overall survival (OS) was analyzed but immature at time of analysis  \n(HR=0.55; 95% CI: 0.36- 0.86). Nearly all patients treated wi th ENHERTU were alive at one year (94.1%; \n95% CI: 90.3- 96.4) compared to 85.9% of patients treated with T -DM1 (95% CI: 80.9- 89.7).  \n \n“ENHERTU is extending the time before disease progression or death and helping to redefine outcomes for \npatients with previously treated HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, and now physicians in China will \nhave this important medicine as an  option for the ir patients ,” said Kiminori N agao, Head of the Asia, South \nand Central America (ASCA) Business Unit, Daiichi Sankyo . “With this approval, ENHERTU has the \npotential to become a  new standard of care in China in the second  line setting for patients with HER2 \npositive metastatic breast cancer.”  \n “This first approval of ENHERTU in China represents a significant advance in the treatment of HER2 \ntargetable tumors and  provides  the opportunity for patients with previously treated HER2 positive metastatic \nbreast cancer to benefit from the potential of th is important  medicine as a second line therapy ,” said Dave \nFredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, AstraZeneca. “ The approval underscores \nour commitment to patients in China, where there has been an increas ed incidence rate of breast  cancer , as \nwe continue to explore the  potential  benefits of ENHERTU earlier in the treatment of HER2 directed \nmetastatic breast cancer and across  HER2 targetable cancer s.”  \n \nThe safety profile of ENHERTU in DESTINY -Breast03 was evaluated in 257 patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic HER2 positive breast cancer and was consistent with previous clinical trials with no new safety\n3 \n concerns identified. The most common adverse events  (AEs)  occurring in ≥ 20% of patients in the \nENHERTU arm were nausea (75.9%), fatigue (49.4%), vomiting (49.0%), neutropenia (42.8%), alopecia \n(37.0%), constipation (34.2%), anemia (32.7%), transaminases increased (31.5%), musculoskeletal pain  \n (31.1%), leukopenia (30.4%), decreased appetite (29.2%), diarrhea (29.2%), thrombocytopenia (25.7%), headache (21.8%) and abdominal pain (21.0%). The most common serious A Es occurring in >1% of patients \nwere interstitial lung disease (ILD) (2.3%) and vomiting (1.9%) . Discontinuation of therapy due to an \nadverse event  occurred in 10.5% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse event \noccurring in >2% of patients associated with permanent discontinuation was ILD (8.2%) .  \n About DESTINY- Breast03   \nDESTINY- Breast03 is a global, head -to-head, randomized, open -label, pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) versus T -DM1 in patients with HER2 positive unresectable \nand/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane.  \n The primary efficacy endpo int of DESTINY- Breast03 is PFS based on BICR. OS i s a key secondary efficacy \noutcome measure. Other s econdary endpoints include ORR, duration of response , PFS based on investigator \nassessment  and safety . Primary results from DESTINY -Breast03 were published in The New England \nJournal of Medicine  with updated PFS and OS results published in The Lancet . \n \nDESTINY- Breast03 enrolled 524 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and \nSouth America.

In DESTINY -Breast04, ENHERTU significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 50% \nversus physician’s choice of chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR]=0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40-0.63; p<0.0001) in patients with HER2 low metastatic breast cancer with hormone receptor (HR) positive or \nHR negative disease. A median progression -free survival  (PFS) of 9.9 months (95% CI: 9.0- 11.3) was seen \nwith ENHERTU versus 5.1 months (95% CI: 4.2-6.8) in those treated with chemotherapy as assessed by \nblinded independent central review (BICR). A 36% reduction in the risk of death ( HR= 0.64; 95% CI: 0.49-\n0.84; p=0.001) also was seen with ENHERTU compared to chemotherapy with a median overall survival (OS) of 23.4 months (95% CI: 20.0-24.8) in patients treated with ENHERTU versus 16.8 months (95% CI: 14.5-20.0) in those treated with chemotherapy.\n2 \n “The European approval of ENHERTU in the HER2 low metastatic breast cancer population marks the first \ntime we will have the opportunity to treat patients with lower levels of HER2  expression with a HER2 \ndirected therapy,” said Javier Cortés, MD, PhD, Head, International Breast Cancer Center (IBCC), \nBarcelona, Spain. “ENHERTU has shown a significant improvement in outcomes compared to \nchemotherapy for these patients, reinforcing its potential to become a new standard of care.”  \n \n“The approval of ENHERTU in HE R2 low metastatic breast cancer represents a significant clinical advance \nfor patients in Europe with both HR  positive and HR negative disease who previously have had limited \ntreatment options in the late -line setting ,” said Ken Keller, Global Head of Onco logy Business, and President \nand CEO, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. “This milestone also supports our vision to bring ENHERTU to more patients \nacross the HER2 spectrum, which requir es a change to the breast cancer classification system that has been \nguiding treatment for more than two decades.”  \n \n“Historically, patients with breast cancer who have tumors with low levels of HER2 expression have been \nclassified as HER2 negative, giving them  limited treatment options beyond chemotherapy,” s aid Dave \nFredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, AstraZeneca. “ This approval reinforces the \nimportant role ENHERTU may have for patients with HER2 low disease  and highlights the need to evolve \nthe way breast cancer is treated  to impr ove outcomes for patients.”  \n \nIn DESTINY -Breast04, t he safety profile of ENHERTU  was consistent with previous clinical trials with no \nnew safety concerns identified. Grade 3 or grade 4 treatment -related  adverse events from a pooled safety \nanalysis of patients treated with ENHERTU ( 5.4 mg/kg) across multiple tumor types in clinical studies \nincluded neutropenia (16.3%), ane mia (9.2%), fatigue (7.5%), leukopenia (6.3%), thrombocytopenia (5.9%), \nnausea (5.6%), lymphopenia (4.8%), transaminases increased (3.9%), hypokalemia (3.5%), vomiting (2.2%), \npneumonia (1.9%), diarrhea (1.8%), decreased appetite (1.7%), febrile neutropenia (1.2%), dyspnea (1.2%), \nblood bilirubin increased (1.1%), ejection fraction decreased (1.1%), and musculoskeletal pain (1.1%). \nGrad e 5 adverse reactions occurred in 1.5% of patients, including interstitial lung disease (1.2%).  \n Financial Considerations  \nFollowing approval in the EU, an amount of $150 million is due from AstraZeneca to Daiichi Sankyo as a \nmilestone payment in HER2 low metastatic breast cancer. Sales of ENHERTU in most EU territories are recognized by Daiichi Sankyo. For further details on the financial arrangements, please consult the collaboration agreement from March 2019.\n3 \n About DESTINY- Breast04  \nDESTINY -Breast04 is a global, randomized, open- label, pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and  \nsafety of ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) versus physician’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin,  \ngemcitabine, paclitaxel or n ab-paclitaxel) in patients with HR positive or HR negative, HER2 low  \nunresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with one or two prior lines of chemotherapy.  \nPatients were randomized 2:1 to receive either ENHERTU  or chemotherapy.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY -Breast04 is PFS in patients with HR positive disease based on BICR.  \nKey secondary endpoints include PFS based on BICR in all randomized patients (HR positive and HR  \nnegative disease), OS in patients with HR positive disease and OS in all randomized patients (HR positive  \nand HR negative disease). Other secondary endpoints include PFS based on investigator assessment,  \nobjective response rate based on BICR and on investigator assessment, duration of response based on BICR  \nand sa fety. DESTINY -Breast04 enrolled 557 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America. \nFor more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.  \n About Breast Cancer and HER2 Expression  \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.\n1 More than two million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020 with nearly 685,000 \ndeaths globally.1 In Europe, approximately 531,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually with nearly \n141,000 deaths.2   \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers, and is one of many biomarkers expressed in \nbreast cancer tumors.3 \n \nHER2 expression is currently determined by an immunohistochemistry (IHC) test which estimates the \namount of HER2 protein on a cancer cell, and/or an in -situ hybridiza tion (ISH) test, which counts the copies \nof the HER2  gene in cancer cells.3,4 HER2 tests provide IHC and ISH scores across the full HER2 spectrum \nand are routinely used to determine appropriate treatment options for patients with metastatic breast cancer. \nHER2 positive cancers are currently defined as HER2 expression measured as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+, and \nHER2 negative cancers are defined as HER2 expression measured as IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -.3 \nHowever, approximately half of all breast cancers are HER 2 low, defined as a HER2 score of IHC 1+ or IHC \n2+/ISH -.5,6,7 HER2 low occurs in both HR positive and HR negative disease.8\n4 \n Currently, patients with HR positive metastatic breast cancer and HER2 low disease have limited effective \ntreatment options fol lowing progression on endocrine (hormone) therapy.9 Additionally, few targeted options \nare available for those with HR negative disease.10  \n \nAbout ENHERTU   \nENHERTU  (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC.

Certain HER2 (ERBB2) gene alterations (called \nHER2  mutations) have been identified in patients with non-squamous NSCLC as a distinct molecular target, \nand occur in approximately 2% to 4% of patients with this type of lung cancer.\n4,5 While HER2  gene \nmutations can occur in a range of patients, they are more commonly found in patients with NSCLC who are younger, female and have never smoked.\n 6 HER2 gene mutations have been independently associated with \ncancer cell growth and poor prognosis, with an increased incidence of brain metastases.7 Next -generation \nsequencing has been utilized in the identification of HER2  (ERBB2 ) mutations.8,9\n3 \n Although the role of anti -HER2 treatment is well established in breast and gastric cancers, there were no \napproved HER2 directed therapies in NSCLC prior to the accelerated U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA) approval of ENHERTU  in unresectable or meta static HER2  mutant NSCLC.10,11 \n About ENHERTU \nENHERTU\n® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 \ndirected antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC \ntechnology, ENHERTU  is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced \nprogram in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide- based \ncleavable linker.   ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 40 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior \n \nanti-HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial. ENHERTU also  is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior \nanti-HER2 -based regimens based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Brazil and the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 low (immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+ or IHC 2+/ in-situ hybridization \n(ISH)) breast cancer who have received a prior systemic therapy in t he metastatic setting or developed \ndisease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n  \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved under accelerated approval in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic non- small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) whose tumors have activating HER2 \n(ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected by a FDA -approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy \nbased on the results from the DESTINY -Lung02 trial. Continued approval for this indication may be \ncontingent upon verification and description of  clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have \nrecei ved a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  and/or \nDESTINY -Gastric02  trial.\n4 \n About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU  \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway. \n \nRegulatory applications for ENHERTU in breast, non- small cell lung and gastric cancers are currently under \nreview in several countries.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020,  except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan. \n \nAbout the DXd ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe DXd ADC portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo currently consists of five ADCs in clinical development across \nmultiple types of cancer. The company’s clini cal trial stage DXd ADCs include ENHERTU, a HER2 \ndirected ADC and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being jointly \ndeveloped and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca; and, patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a \nHER3 directed ADC. Two additional ADCs including ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd; DS -7300), a B7 -H3 \ndirected ADC, and DS-6000, a CDH6 directed ADC, are being developed through a strategic early- stage \nresearch collaboration with Sarah Cannon Research Institute.  Each ADC is designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology to target and deliver a cytotoxic payload inside cancer cells that express a specific cell surface antigen. Each ADC consists of a \nmonoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, \nDXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n Datopotamab deruxtecan, ifinatamab deruxtecan,  patritumab deruxtecan and DS -6000 are investigational \nmedicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established. \n \nAbout  Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our world-\nclass science and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the \nworld.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular disease, Daiichi\n5 \n Sankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as wel l as other diseases \nwith high unmet medical needs.

    "content": "Press Release  \nENHERTU® Approved in the EU for Patients with Previously Treated \nHER2 Positive Advanced Gastric Cancer  \n \n• First HER2 directed medicine to be approved for gastric cancer in the EU in more than a decade  \n• Based on DESTINY -Gastric02 and DESTINY -Gastric01 where Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s \nENHERTU demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy  \n \nTokyo and Munich  – (December  19, 2022) – Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568 ) and AstraZeneca ’s \n(LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) ENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan)  has been approved in the European Union \n(EU) as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced HER2 positive gastric or \ngastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have receiv ed a prior trastuzumab -based regimen.  \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly \ndeveloped and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca.  \n \nApproximately 136,000 cases of gastric cancer are diagnosed annually in Europe , where it represents the \nsixth leading cause of cancer death .1,2 Gastric cancer is typically diagnosed in the advanced stage , and e ven \nwhen the disease is diagnosed at earlier stages, the survival rate remains modest.3,4 Approximately one in five \ngastric cancers are HER2 positive.5,6 \n \nThe approval by the European Commission follows the positive opinion  of the Committee for Medicinal \nProducts for Human Use in November 2022 and is based on results from the DESTINY -Gastric02  and \nDESTINY -Gastric01  phase 2 trials.  \n“Today’s news is a welcome advance for patients with HER2 positive ad vanced gastric cancer,” said Eric \nVan Cutsem, MD, PhD, Head of Department of Oncology , University of Leuven, Belgium  and Founding \nChair of the ESMO -GI/World Congress of Gastrointestinal Cancers . “Patients with this disease face poor \noutcomes following progression on initial treatment with a HER2 directed medicine as many do not respond \nto further treatment, and even those that do respond often do not have durable responses. Data from the \nDESTINY -Gastric02 and DESTINY -Gastric01 trials support ENHERTU becoming a new standard of care \nfor patient s in this setting.”\n2 \n  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric02, which enrolled patients from Europe and North America, treatment with \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) resulted in a confirmed ob jective response rate (ORR) of 41.8% (95% confidence \ninterval [CI] : 30.8 -53.4) as assessed by independent central review (ICR). Median duration of response \n(DoR) was 8.1 months  (95% CI: 5.9 -NE).  \n \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, which enrolled patients from Japan and South Korea, treatment with ENHERTU \nresulted in a confirmed ORR of 40.5% versus 11.3% with chemotherapy (irinotecan or paclitaxel) as \nassessed by ICR. The median DoR was 11.3 months with ENHERTU versus 3.9 months with  chemotherapy . \nPatients treated with ENHERTU had a 4 1% reduction in the risk of death versus patients treated with \nchemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.39 -0.88, p=0.0097 ) with a median OS of 12.5 months \n(95% CI: 9.6-14.3) versus 8. 4 months (95 % CI: 6. 9-10.7). \n \n“ENHERTU is the first antibody drug conjugate to be approved in Europe for advanced gastric cancer, \nrepresenting a major advance in treating this difficult -to-treat cancer,” said Ken Keller, Global Head of \nOncology Business, and President and CEO, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. “ With this approval , we can now offer \npatients with previously treated HER2 positive gastric cancer a treatment with  clinically meaningful \nefficacy.”    \n“Today’s important approval  makes  ENHERTU the first HER2 directe d medicine to be approved for gastric \ncancer in the European Union in more than a decade,” said Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, \nOncology Business Unit, AstraZeneca. “ Patients across the EU with advanced HER2 positive  disease who \nhave progressed  following treatment in the first -line setting may now have the potential opportunity to \nbenefit  from treatment with ENHERTU.”   \nIn both trials, the safety profiles observed in patients treated with ENHERTU were consistent with those seen \nin other trials of ENHERTU with no new safety signals identified.  Grade 3 or grade 4 treatment -related \nadverse events from a pooled safety analysis  of patients treated with ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) across multiple \ntumor types in clinical studies included neutropenia (27.9%), anemia (23.1%) , leukopenia (12.9%), \nthrombocytopenia (9.0%), fatigue (8.2%) , decreased appetite (8.1%), lymphopenia (7.4%), nausea  (5.8%), \nincreased transaminases (4.7%), hypokal emia (4.2%), pne umonia (2.9%), febrile neutropenia (2.9%), \nvomiting (2.4%), diarrhea (2.1%) , decreased weight (2.1%), increased blood alkaline phosphate (1.8%), \ninterstitial lung disease  (ILD) (1.6%), dysp nea (1.3%) and decrease ejection fraction (1. 1%). Grade 5 \ntreatment -related events occurred in 2.6% of patients including ILD ( 1.9%).\n3 \n  \nFinancial Considerations  \nFollowing approval in the EU, an amount of $35 million is due from AstraZeneca to Daiichi Sankyo as a \nsecond -line milestone payment in HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer . Sales of ENHERTU in  most  EU \nterritories are recognized by Daiichi Sankyo.  For further details on the financial arrangements, please consult \nthe collaboration agreement from  March  2019 . \n \nAbout DESTINY -Gastric02  \nDESTINY -Gastric02 is an open -label, single -arm phase 2 trial in patients evaluating the efficacy and safety \nof ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) in patients with HER2 positive  metastatic and/or unresectable gastric or GEJ \nadenocarcinoma with disease progression on or after a trastuzumab -containing regimen.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY -Gastric02 is confirmed ORR based on ICR. Secondary endpoints \ninclude progression -free survival ( PFS), OS, DoR and safety. Primary results from the DESTINY -Gastric02 \nphase 2  trial were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress  2021 with \nupdated data presented at 2022 ESMO.  \n \nDESTINY -Gastric02 enrolled 79 patients at multiple sites in North America a nd Europe.  For more \ninformation about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout DESTINY -Gastric01  \nDESTINY -Gastric01 is a randomized, open -label phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) in patients with primarily HER2 positive (defined as immunohistochemistry (IHC) \n3+ or IHC 2+/ in-situ hybridization (ISH)+) advanced gastric cancer or GEJ adenocarcinoma with disease \nprogression following  two or mo re prior treatment regimens including fluoropyrimidine (5 -FU), platinum \nchemotherapy and trastuzumab. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive ENHERTU or physician’s choice of \nchemotherapy (paclitaxel or irinotecan monotherapy).  \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY -Gastric01  is ORR . Secondary endpoints include OS, PFS, DoR , disease \ncontrol rate and time to treatment failure as well as pharmacokinetic and safety endpoints.  The primary \nanalysis was published in The New England Journal of Medicine  with updated data presented at the 2021 \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting . \n \nDESTINY -Gastric01 enrolled 187 patients at multiple sites in Japan and South Korea. For more information \nabout the trial, visit  ClinicalTrials.gov .\n4 \n  \nAbout HER2 Positive Gastric Cancer  \nGastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the fourth highest leading cause of \ncancer mortality, with a five -year global survival rate of 5% to 10% for advanced or metastatic disease.3,7,8 \nApproximately one million new patients were diagnosed with  gastric cancer  in 2020, with  768,000 deaths \nreported globally .2 In Europe, approximately 136,000 cases of gastric cancer are diagnosed annually, and \nEastern Europe has the second highest incidence of gastric cancer worldwide after Eastern Asia .2,8 Gastric \ncancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer death in Europe  and is typically diagnosed in the advanced stage , \nand even when diagnosed in earlier stages  of the disease , the survival rate remains modest.1,3,4  \n \nApproximately one in five gastric cancers are HER2 positive.5,6 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth \npromoting protein expressed on the su rface of many types of tumors including breast, gastric, lung and \ncolorectal cancers .5 HER2  overexpression may be associated with a specific HER2 gene alteration known as \nHER2 amplification.6 \n \nRecommended first -line treatment in the EU for HER2 positive advanced or metastatic gastric cancer is \ncombination chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, an anti -HER2 medicine, which has been shown to improve \nsurvival outcomes when added to chemotherapy.9,10 For patients with metastatic gastric cancer that  \nprogress es following initial treatment with a trastuzumab -based regimen, there were previously no other \napproved HER2 directed medicines in the EU prior to the approval of ENHERTU .7,11,12 \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC.

The recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission, which has \nthe authority to grant marketing authorizations for medicines in the EU. \n \nIn DESTINY -Breast04 , ENHERTU  reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 50%  versus \nphysician’s choice of chemotherapy (hazard ratio [ HR]=0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI ]: 0.40-0.63; \np<0.001) in patients with HER2  low metastatic breast cancer with hormone receptor ( HR) positive or HR \nnegative disease. A median progression- free survival ( PFS) of 9.9 months (95% CI: 9.0-11.3) was seen with \nENHERTU  versus 5.1 months (95% CI: 4.2-6.8) in those treated with chemotherapy as assessed by blinded \nindependent central review ( BICR). A 36% reduction in the risk of death (HR=0.64; 95% CI: 0.49-0.84; \np=0.001) also was seen with ENHERTU compared to chemotherapy with a median  overall survival ( OS) of \n23.4 months (95% CI: 20.0- 24.8) in patients treated with ENHERTU  versus 16.8 months (95% CI: 14.5-\n20.0) in those treated with chemotherapy .\n2 \n “This positive CHMP opinion recognizes the unmet need in the European Union for patients with HER2 low \nmetastatic breast cancer . Currently, once patients with HR positive disease progress on hormone therapy \nthere are limited effective treatments, and few targeted options are available  for patients with HR negative \ndisease,”  said Ken Takeshita, MD,  Global Head , R&D , Daiichi Sankyo. “We look forward to the European \nCommission decision and aim to bring ENHERTU to eligible patients as soon as possible.” \n   \n“ENHERTU  is the first ever HER2  directed medicine to show a survival benefit in patients with HER2 low \nmetastatic breast cancer, confirming the importance of targeting lower levels of HER2 expression in patients \npreviously classified as HER2 negative,”  said Susan Galbraith, MBBCh, PhD, E xecutive Vice President, \nOncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “The CHMP’s recommendation is encouraging and supports our ambition to \nevolve the way breast cancer is classified and treated to ultimately improve patient outcomes.”  \n \nIn DESTINY -Breast04, t he safety pro file of ENHERTU  was consistent with previous clinical trials with no \nnew safety concerns identified. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment emergent adverse events were \nneutropenia (13.7%), anemia (8.1%), fatigue ( 7.5%), leukopenia (6.5%), thrombocytopenia (5.1%), nausea \n(4.6%), increased aminotransferase  (3.2%), decreased appetite (2.4%), vomiting (1.3%) and diarrhea (1.1 %). \nInterstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis rates were consistent with that observed in lat e-line HER2 \npositive breast cancer trials of ENHERTU, as determined by an independent adjudication committee. \nOverall, 12.1% of patients had confirmed ILD or pneumonitis related to treatment as determined by an independent adjudication committee. The majority of ILD events (10.0%) were primarily low grade (grade 1 (3.5%) or grade 2 (6.5%)) with five grade 3 (1.3%), no grade 4 and three grade 5 (0.8%) events reported.  \n ENHERTU is approved in the EU for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastati c HER2 positive \nbreast cancer who have received one or more prior anti -HER2 -based regimens and for the treatment of \npatients with previously treated HER2 positive advanced gastric cancer who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen. ENHERTU is not c urrently approved in the EU for the treatment of HER2 low \nmetastatic breast cancer  and is subject to additional monitoring.  \n About DESTINY- Breast04  \nDESTINY -Breast04 is a global, randomized, open- label, pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and  \nsafety of ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) versus physician’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin,  \ngemcitabine, paclitaxel or nab -paclitaxel) in patients with HR positive or HR negative, HER2 low \nunresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with one or two prior lines of chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either ENHERTU  or chemotherapy.\n3 \n The primary endpoint of DESTINY -Breast04 is PFS in patients with HR positive disease based on BICR.  \nKey secondary endpoints include PFS based on BICR in all randomized patients (HR positive and HR  \nnegative disease), OS in patients with HR positive disease and OS in all randomized patients (HR positive  \nand HR negative disease). Other secondary endpoints include PFS based on investigator ass essment,  \nobjective response rate based on BICR and on investigator assessment, duration of response based on BICR  \nand safety. DESTINY -Breast04 enrolled 557 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America. \nFor more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.  \n \nAbout Breast Cancer and HER2 Expression  \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.1 More than two million cases of  breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020 with nearly 685,000 \ndeaths globally.1 In Europe, approximately 531,000 cases of  breast cancer  are diagnosed annually with nearly \n141,000 deaths .2   \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of  \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers, and is one o f many biomarkers expressed in  \nbreast cancer tumors .3 \n \nHER2 expression is currently determined by an immunohistochemistry ( IHC) test which estimates the \namount of HER2 protein on a  cancer cell, and/or an in-situ hybridization ( ISH) test, which counts the copies \nof the HER2  gene in cancer cells.3,4 HER2 tests  provide IHC and ISH scores across the full HER2 spectrum \nand are routinely used to determine appropriate  treatment options for patients with metastatic breast cancer. \nHER2 posi tive cancers are currently defined as HER2 expression measured as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+, and \nHER2 negative cancers are defined as HER2  expression measured as IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -.3 \nHowever, approximately half of all breast cancers  are HER2 low, defined as a HER2 score of IHC  1+ or IHC \n2+/ISH -.5,6,7 HER2 low occurs in both HR  positive and HR negative disease.8 \n \nCurrently, patients with HR positive metastatic breast cancer and HER2 low disease have  limited effective  \ntreatment options following progression on endocrine (hormone) therapy.9 Additionally, few targeted options \nare available for those with HR negative disease.10  \n About ENHERTU   \nENHERTU  (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU  is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific\n4 \n platform. ENHERTU  consists of a HER2 m onoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor \npayload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 40 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior  anti-\nHER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have  \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of c ompleting therapy  based on the results from  \nthe DESTINY -Breast03  trial. ENHERTU  also is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult  \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior  \nanti-HER2 -based regimens based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Brazil and the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior \nsystemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six m onths of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy  based on the results of the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved under accelerated approval in the U.S . for the treatment of adult patients  \nwith unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2  \n(ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected by an FDA -approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy \nbased on the results fro m the DESTINY -Lung02 trial. Continued approval for this indication may be  \ncontingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n ENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is appr oved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally  \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have  \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  and/or \nDESTINY -Gastric02  trial. \n About the ENHERTU  Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU  \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers.  \nTrials in combination with other anticancer tre atments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n \nRegulatory applications for ENHERTU  in breast , non-small cell lung  and gastric cancer s are currently under \nreview in several  countries.\n5 \n  \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca  Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU  in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the \nmanufacturing and supply of ENHERTU  and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nAbout the DXd ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe DXd ADC portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo currently consists of five ADCs in clinical development across multiple types of cancer. The company’s clinical trial stage DXd ADCs include ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato- DXd), a TROP2  directed ADC, which are being jointly \ndeveloped and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca; and, patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a \nHER3 directed ADC. Two additional ADCs including ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd; DS -7300), a B7 -H3 \ndirected ADC, and DS -6000, a CDH6 directed ADC, are being developed through a strategic early- stage \nresearch collaboration with Sarah  Cannon Research Institute.  \n Each ADC is designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology to target and deliver a \ncytotoxic payload inside cancer cells that express a specific cell surface antigen. Each ADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.  \n \nDatopotamab der uxtecan, ifinatamab deruxtecan,  patritumab deruxtecan and DS -6000 are investigational \nmedicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been \nestablished.  \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our  world -\nclass science and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the \nworld.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular disease, Daiichi  \nSankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as well as other diseases  \nwith high unmet medical needs.

    "content": "Press Release  \n \nENHERTU® Supplemental New Drug Application Submitted in Japan \nfor Patients with HER2 Mutant Metastatic Non -Small Cell Lung \nCancer \n \n• Submission based on  DESTINY-Lung02 and DESTINY -Lung01 results where ENHERTU demonstrated \nclinically meaningful tumor response s  \n \nTokyo – ( December 13 , 2022)  – Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) today announced that it has submitted a \nsupplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) \nfor ENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan ) for the treatment of adult patients  with  previously treated HER2  \nmutant unresectable advanced or recurrent non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  \n \nLung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed form of cancer in Japan, with more than 138,000 cases \ndiagnosed in 2020.1 Prognosis is particularly poor for patients with metastatic NS CLC as only approximately \n8% will live beyond five years after diagnosis.2 In Japan, only 18.2% of patients with metastatic NSCLC will \nlive beyond three years after diagnosis.3 There are currently no HER2 directed therapies specifically for the \ntreatment of HER2 mutant NSCLC  approved in Japan, which occurs  in approximately 2% to 4% of patients \nwith NSCLC and non-squamous histology.4,5,6,7 \n \n“The results of DESTINY -Lung01 and DESTINY-Lung02 have shown that ENHERTU demonstrate s a \nclinically meaningful tumor response in patients with previously treated HER2  mutant non -small cell lung \ncancer,” said Wataru Takasaki, PhD, Executive Officer, Head of R&D Division in Japan, Daiichi Sankyo. \n“We look forward to working closely with the Japan Health Authority to bring the first HER2 directed \ntherapy for lung cancer to physicians and patients, represent ing the third tumor type for which ENHERTU \ncould pot entially be approved for use in Japan.”   \n \nThe s NDA is based on data from the DESTINY -Lung02 phase 2 trial presented  at the European Society for \nMedical Oncology (ESMO) 2022 Congress, and the  DESTINY -Lung01 phase 2 trial  published in The New \nEngland Journal of Medicine  with updated data also presented at ESMO 2022.  \n ENHERTU also has been  granted  Orphan Drug designation by the Japan MHLW for this tumor type based \non these data. Therapies that receive this designation are for those being developed for serious, difficult -to-\n2 \n treat diseases affecting  fewer than 50,000 patients in Japan and  qualify for several measures intended to \nsupport development including priority review of an application . \n \nAbout DESTINY- Lung02  \nDESTINY -Lung02 is a global, randomized phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU  in \npatients with HER2  mutant metastatic NSCLC with disease recurrence or progression during or after at least \none regimen of prior anticancer therapy that must have contained a platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients  \nwere randomized 2:1 to receive ENHERTU  5.4 mg/kg (Cohort 1; n=102) or ENHERTU  6.4 mg/kg (Cohort \n2; n=50).   The primary endpoint of the trial is confirmed objective response rate ( ORR ) as assessed by blinded \nindependent central review ( BICR). Secondary endpoints include confirmed disease contro l rate ( DCR ), \nduration of response ( DoR ) and progression free survival ( PFS) assessed by investigator and BICR, \ninvestigator- assessed overall survival ( OS) and safety. DESTINY -Lung02 enrolled 152 patients at multiple \nsites, including Asia, Europe , Oceania and North America. For more information about the trial, visit  \nClinicalTrials.gov . \n About DESTINY- Lung01  \nDESTINY -Lung01 is a global phase 2, open- label, two -cohort trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg) in patients with HER2  mutant ( Cohort 2, n=91) or HER2 \noverexpressing ( Cohort 1 and 1a, n=90) (defined as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+) unresectable or metastatic  \nnon-squamous NSCLC relapsed from or refractory to standard treatment or for which no standard treatment \nis available.   \n The primary endpoint of the trial is confirmed ORR by independent central review. Key secondary endpoints \ninclude DoR, DCR, PFS, OS and safety. DESTINY- Lung01 enrolled 181 patients at multiple sites, including \nAsia, Europe and North America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout  HER2  Mutant  NSCLC            \nLung cancer is the second most common form of cancer globally, with more than two million cases diagnosed in 2020.\n8 In Japan, lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, with more than \n138,000 cases diagnosed in 2020.1 Prognosis is particularly poor for patients with metastatic NSCLC , as only \napproximately 8% will live beyond five years after diagnosis.2 In Japan, only 18.2% of patients with \nmetastatic NSCLC will live beyond three years after diagnosis.3\n3 \n HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors, including lung, breast, gastric  and colorectal cancers. Certain HER2  (ERBB2)  gene alterations (called \nHER2  mutations) have been identified in patients with non- squamous NSCLC as a distinct molecular target, \nand occur in approximately 2%  to 4% of patients with this type of lung cancer .4,5 While HER2  gene \nmutations can occur in a range of patients, they are more commonly found in patients with NSCLC who are \nyounger, female and have never smoked.9 HER2 gene mutations have been independently associated with \ncancer cell growth and poor prognosis, with an increased incidence of brain metastases .10  Next -generation \nsequencing is being utilized in the identification of HER2  (ERBB2 ) mutations .11 \n Although the role of anti -HER2 treatment is well es tablished in breast and gastric cancers, there were  no \napproved HER2 directed therapies  in NSCLC prior to the accelerated U.S. Food and Drug Administration \napproval of ENHERTU  in unresectable or metastatic HER2  mutant NSCLC.\n6,7  \n About ENHERTU  \nENHERTU  (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nantibody drug conjugate ( ADC ).

Results were presented  today as a poster  presentation  \n(Abstract #P6 -10-03) at the 2022 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (#SABCS22).  \n \nDatopotamab deruxtecan is  a specifically engineered  TROP2 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC)  \nbeing jointly developed by Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) . \n \nApproximately 15% of breast cancer s are considered triple negative and are  associated with higher disease \nrecurrence and worse prognosis compared to other breast cancer subtypes.1,2 It is estimated that only 12% of \npatients with metastatic TNBC survive five years after diagnosis and median overall survival is between 12 \nto 18 months .1,3 \n \nIn the TNBC cohort of TROPION -PanTumor01 (n=44)  where patients  previously received a median of \nthree lines of treatment for metastatic disease , datopotamab deruxtecan demonstrated an objective response \nrate (ORR) of 32%, including one complete response (CR), 13 partial responses (PRs) and 18 cases of stable \ndisease (SD) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). In a subgroup of 27 patients  who \nhad not been previously treated  with topoisomerase I inhibitor -based ADCs , the ORR was  44% including \none CR, 11 PRs  and 10 cases of SD. The median duration of response (DoR) was 16.8 months  (95% \nconfidence interval [ CI]: 5.6-NE) across patient groups .\n2 \n “Triple  negative breast cancer is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer with the average survival rate \nof less than 18 months for patients with pretreated metastatic disease, ” said Aditya Bardia, MD, MPH, \nDirector of Brea st Cancer Research Program, Mass General Cancer Center and Associate Professor of \nMedicine at Harvard Medical School.  “The durable tumor response and disease control seen with \ndatopotamab deruxtecan in patients with pretreated triple negative breast cancer  are encouraging, \nparticularly in those patients who had not received previous treatment  with topoisomerase I inhibitor -based  \nantibody drug conjugate .”  \n \nIn the overall cohort , datopotamab deruxtecan demonstrated median progression- free survival ( PFS) of 4.4 \nmonths (95% CI : 3.0-7.3) and median overall survival ( OS) of 13.5 months (95% CI : 10.1-16.3) . In the \nsubgroup of patients who had not been previously treated with a topoisomerase I inhibitor , median PFS and \nOS were 7.3 months (95% CI : 3.0-18.0) and 14.3 months (95% CI : 10.5- NE), respectively. The disease \ncontrol rate (DCR) was consistent across the overall cohort and previously untreated subgroup at 8 0% and \n81%, respectively.   \nThe safety profile of datopotamab deruxtecan was consistent with previous ly reported data with no new \nsafety signals identified. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  \nwere stomatitis (11%), decreased lymphocyte  count ( 7%), fatigue ( 7%), vomiting ( 5%),  anemia (2%),  \ndecreased neutrophil count (2%) and nausea (2%) . Serious TEAEs were reported in nine patients (20.5%). \nTreatment discontinuations occurred in one patient (2%) due to grade 1 pneumonitis, which was adjudicated \nas not  treatment -related interstitial lung dise ase (ILD). No cases of ILD w ere observed.  No cases of febrile \nneutropenia or grade 3 or higher diarrhea were observed.  \n \n“Five-year survival rates  for previously treated metastatic triple negative  breast cancer are significantly  \nlower than other subtypes of breast cancer, underscoring the need for new, durable therap ies,” said Mark \nRutstein, MD, Global Head, Oncology Clinical Development,  Daiichi Sankyo.  “We are working with \nurgency and care to evaluate datopotamab deruxtecan  in multiple treatment settings in phase 3 trials, \nincluding the TROPION- Breast02 first-line phase 3 trial in patients with locally recurrent inoperable or \nmetastatic triple negative breast cancer not candidates for anti -PD-L1 therapy.”   \n \n“The median duration of response of nearly 17 months  seen in the TROPION -PanTumor01 trial in these \npatients  reinforces the potential  of datopotamab deruxtecan to treat this persistent  disease ,” sai d Cristian \nMassacesi, MD, Chief Medical Officer and  Oncology Chief Deve lopment Officer, AstraZeneca . “These  \nresults, along with the promising clinical response in combination with durvalumab seen in the BEGONIA \ntrial,  underscore the potential role of this TROP2 directed antibody drug conjugate  for patients with triple \nnegativ e breast cancer  as both a monotherapy and in combinations .”\n3 \n  \nPatients in the TROPION- PanTumor01 trial were heavily pre treated , receiving  a median of three prior \nregimens  in the metastatic setting (range, 1 -10). Prior treatments include d taxanes (9 3%), anthracyclines \n(75%), capecitabine (61%) , platinum -based chemotherapy (52%), immunotherapy (45%), topoisomerase I \ninhibitor -based ADCs (3 2%) and PARP inhibitors (18%) .

Among the 53 evaluable patients, there were four CRs and 35 PRs. \nResponses were observed regardless of PD -L1 expression (low an d high tumors) with 82% of patients \ncontinuing to respond at the time of data cut -off on July 22,  2022. These data were presented as a Spotlight \nPoster Discussion (abstract #PD11- 09) at SABCS on December 8 . \n \nThe safety profile of datopotamab deruxtecan in combination with durvalumab  was consistent with the \nknown safety profiles of both agents . The most common all -grade TEAEs occurring in 20% or more of\n4 \n patients were nausea (57.4%), stomatitis (55.7%), alopecia (45.9%), fatigue (39.3%), constipation (39.3%), \nrash (27.9%) and vomiting (21.3%). Serious TEAEs were observed in 10 (16.4%) patients . Treatment \ndiscontinuations due to an adverse event occurred in  four patients (6.6%).  Two (3.3%) cases  were \nadjudicated as treatment -related grade 1 ILD. \n Twenty -five patients (41.0%) had not received prior treatment  for metastatic TNBC . Prior treatments  for \npatients with disease progression following treatment for early -stage disease include d radiotherapy (49.2%), \nanthracycline s (45.9%), taxanes (41.0%), platinum -based chemotherapy (14.8%), hormonal therapy (14.8%) \nand targeted therapy (4.9%). Seven (11.5%) patients had high PD-L1 expression (tumor area positivity \n[TAP] ≥10%) and 53 patients (86.9%) had low PD -L1 expression (TAP<10%) . At data cut -off, 45 patients \nremained on  study treatment . \n Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca have a broad clinical development program for datopotamab deruxtecan in \nTNBC, including the recently initiated global TROPION- Breast03 phase 3  trial evaluating  datopotamab \nderuxtecan with and without durvalumab in patients with stage 1 to 3 TNBC  with residual disease after \nneoadjuvant therapy. The first patients  were enrolled in November 2022 and are expected to be dosed in \nDecember 2022. SWOG Cancer Research Network Clinical Trials Partnerships (SWOG CTP) is the lead \nacademic group for the trial and a key collaborator in its protocol development, US site selection and \nplanned recruitment and analysis .  \n About TROPION- PanTumor01 \nTROPION- PanTumor01 is a first -in-human, open- label, two -part, multicenter phase 1 trial evaluating the \nsafety  and preliminary efficacy of datopotamab deruxtecan in patients with advanced solid tumors that have \nrelapsed  or are refractory  to standard treatment or for which  no standard treatment is available . The dose \nescalation portion of the trial enrolled patients with non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC ) to assess the safety \nand efficacy of datopotamab deruxtecan to determine the recommended dose for expansion (6 mg/kg). The \ndose expansion part of TROPION -PanTumor01 is enrolling several different cohorts including patients with \nNSCLC, TNBC, HR positive, H ER2 low or negative breast cancer , small cell lung cancer , urothelial , \ngastric , pancreatic, castration resistant prostate  and esophageal cancer . \n Safety endpoints include dose -limiting toxicities and serious adverse events. Efficacy endpoints include \nORR, DoR, time to response , PFS and OS. Pharmacokinetic, biomarker and immunogenicity endpoints also \nare being evaluated.\n5 \n About BEGONIA  \nBEGONIA is an open- label, two -part, multicenter phase 1b/2 trial evaluating durvalumab in combination \nwith oncology therapies with or without paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of metastatic TNBC. Arm 7 of \nthe trial is  evaluating the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of datopotamab deruxtecan in \ncombination with durvalumab in patients with previously untreated,  unresectable locally advanced or \nmetastatic TNBC.  \n \nThe primary endpoints are safety and tolerability. The secondary endpoints include investigator -assessed \nORR, PFS , DoR and OS.  \n \nAbout Triple Negative Breast Cancer \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide .4 More than two million  breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2020 with nearly 685,000 deaths \nglobally.4  \n \nApproximately 15% of breast cancers are considered triple negative , which  is defined by tumors that test \nnegative for estrogen and progesterone hormone receptors (HRs) and  low or negative for human epidermal \ngrowth factor 2 receptor (HER2) , as determined by an  immunohisto chemistry  (IHC) test and/or an i n-situ \nhybridization (ISH) test.1 Tumors  with HER2 expression measured as IHC 0 are considered HER2 negative \nand tumors with HER2 expression measured as  IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH - are considered HER2 low .1,5 TNBC \nis considered the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer.1,2 Compared to patients with other breast cancer \nsubtypes, the prognosis for patients with metastatic TNBC is generally worse with a five-year survival rate \nestimated at 12% and a median overall survival rate of 12 to 18 months.1,3  \n \nTROP2 (trophoblast cell -surface antigen 2) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is broadly expressed  in \nseveral types of solid tumors, including approximately 80% of patients with TNBC .6,7,8 TROP2 expression \nis an unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival in all types of breast cancer .6  \n \nAbout Datopotamab Deruxtecan (Dato- DXd)  \nDatopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) is an investigational TROP2 directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi \nSankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, datopotam ab deruxtecan is one of the three lead ADCs in the \noncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanced programs in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific platform. Datopotamab deruxtecan is comprised of a humanized anti -TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal \nantibody, developed in collaboration with Sapporo Medical University, attached to a number of \ntopoisomerase I inhibitor payloads , an exatecan derivative, via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linkers.\n6 \n A comprehensive development program called TROPION is underway globally with more than 10 trials \nevaluating the efficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan across multiple TROP2 targetable tumors , \nincluding NSCLC, TNBC  and HR positive , HER2  low or negative breast cancer. Trials in combination with \nother anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \nAbout  the Daiichi Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to j ointly develop and commercialize \ndatopotamab deruxtecan in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. \nDaiichi Sankyo is respons ible for the manufacturing and supply of datopotamab deruxtecan.   \n \nAbout  Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our world-\nclass science and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the \nworld.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular disease, Daiichi \nSankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as well as other diseases \nwith high unmet medical needs.

All responses were partial ( n=11 ) and \n56% of patients achieved stable disease ( n=23). The disease control rate (DCR) was  85% and median \nprogression -free survival (PFS) was 8.3 months (95% confidence interval [C I]: 5.5-11.1). With median \nfollow -up of 13.7 months  (range, 9 -16), the median duration of response (DoR ; 95% CI : 4.4-NE) and the \nmedian overall survival (OS) had not been reached with 59% of patients alive for more than one year.  \n \n“Patients with HR positive , HER2 low or negative  metastatic breast cancer who are not eligible for \nendocrine therapy or have exhausted treatment options have a  poor prognosis ,” said presenting author Funda\n2 \n Meric -Bernstam, MD, Chair of the Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics at The University of \nTexas MD Anderson Cancer Center. “ These preliminary results with datopotamab deruxtecan in patients \nwith heavily pretreated HR positive , HER2 low or negative  metastatic breast cancer are encouraging and \nwarrant further evaluation in this setting. ”  \n \nThe safety profile of datopotamab deruxtecan was consistent with previous data  with no new safety signals \nidentified. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were decreased \nlympho cyte count ( 15%), stomatitis ( 10%), anemia ( 7%), dyspnea (2%) and fatigue (2%) . Serious TE AEs \nwere observed in six (15%) patient s, including one death due to dyspnea  that was not considered treatment -\nrelated . Treatment discontinuations due to an adverse event occurred in five ( 12%) patients.  No cases of \ngrade 3 or higher diarrhea or febrile neutropenia were observed. One case of grade 3 interstitial lung disease \nwas adjudicated as treatment -related.  \n \n“These results add to the growing body of data demonstrating the potential of datopotamab deruxtecan to \ntreat c ertain types of metastatic breast cancer ,” said Mark Rutstein, MD, Global Head , Oncology  Clinical \nDevelopment , Daiichi Sankyo . “We look forward to  the continued evaluation of our TROP2 directed \nantibody drug conjugate , including comparisons  to standard therapy in earlier lines of treatment for HR \npositive, HER2 low or negative metastatic breast cancer through our ongoing TROPION -Breast01 phase 3 \ntrial.”  \n \n“Many of these p atients  with metastatic breast cancer  in TROPION -PanTumor01 had exhausted most of \ntheir available treatment options, having received a  striking  median of five prior regimens , including a \nCDK4/6 inhibitor  for nearly all patients ,” said Cristian Massacesi, MD, Chief Medical Officer and \nOncology  Chief Development Officer, AstraZeneca.  “These pr omising results with datopotamab deruxtecan  \nin such a heavily pretreated patient population support our strong belief that this TROP2 directed antibody \ndrug conjugate has the  potential to improve outcomes f or patients with HR positive , HER2 low or negative  \nbreast cancer  in this , and possibly earlier settings .” \n \nPatients in this cohort  were heavily pretreated , receiv ing a median of five  prior lines of treatment in the \nmetastatic setting (range , 3-10).

Datopotamab deruxtecan is comprised of a humanized anti -TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal \nantibody, developed in collaboration with Sapporo Medical University, attached to a number of \ntopoisomerase I inhibit or payload s, an exatecan derivative, via tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker s. \n \nA comprehensive development program called TROPION is underway globally with more than 10 trials \nevaluating the efficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan across multiple TROP2 targetable tumors, \nincluding NSCLC, TNBC and HR positive , HER2 low or negative  breast cancer. Trials in combination with \nother anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are  also underway . \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collabo ration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \ndatopotamab  deruxtecan in July 2020 , except in J apan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. \nDaiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nAbout  Daiichi  Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our world -\nclass science  and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the \nworld.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular disease, Daiichi \nSankyo is primarily fo cused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as well as other diseases\n5 with high unmet medical needs.

These r esults  and primary results from the DESTINY -\nBreast02  phase 3 trial (Abstract #GS2- 01) will be presented today at the 2022 San Antonio Breast Cancer \nSymposium (#SABCS 22), with the updated results from DESTINY -Breast03 simultaneous ly publi shed in \nThe Lancet . \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly  \ndeveloped and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo (TSE:4568) and AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN).  \n In the key secondary endpoint analysis of OS in DESTINY- Breast03, ENHERTU demonstrated a 36% \nreduction in risk of death  versus T -DM1 (hazard ratio [HR]  = 0.64; 95% confiden ce interval [CI] 0.47- 0.87; \np=0.0037). In both treatment arms, median OS was not yet reached (ENHERTU [40.5- NE] versus T -DM1 \n[34.0- NE]) after a median duration of follow -up of 28.4 months for ENHERTU and 26.5 months for T -DM1. \nIn the ENHERTU arm, an estima ted 77.4% of patients were alive at two  years (95% CI: 71.7- 81.2) compared \nto 69.9 % of patients treated with T -DM1  (95% CI: 63.7- 75.2) . The observed survival benefit was consistent \nacross all analyzed subgroups, including patients with or without baseline brain metastases, with or without \nbaseline visceral disease, those who were hormone receptor (HR) positive or HR negative and patients \nregardless of prior pertuzumab or lines of systemic therapy.  \n \n“The main goals of therapy for advanced breast cancer are to control the disease and improve  survival, and it \nis therefore critical to continue to improve upon existing treatment options, particularly in the metastatic\n2 \n setting ,” said Sara Hurvitz, MD, Medical Oncologist, Professor of Medicine and Director of the Breast \nCancer Clinical Trials Program in the Division of Hematology -Oncology at the David Geffen School of \nMedicine at UCL A, and Medical D irector for the Clinical Research Unit at the UCLA Jonsson \nComprehensive Cancer Center in Santa Monica, CA . “For patients with HER2  positive breast cancer who \nexperience disease progression following initial treatment in the metastatic setting, ENHERTU  has shown \nsignificant improvement in survival compared to T -DM1, further confirming this medicine  as the new \nstandard of care.”  \n \nWith the additional follow -up in DESTINY -Breast03, ENHERTU also continue d to demonstrate a clinically \nmeaningful improvement in progression- free survival (PFS) with a 22  month improvement in median PFS \nover T -DM1 , reaffirming the statistically significant finding at the previous interim analysis . The updated \nexploratory analysi s was not tested for statistical significance and not powered to show differences between \ntreatment arms. The median PFS for patients in the  ENHERTU arm was 28.8 months (HR=0.33; 95% CI : \n22.4- 37.9) compared to 6.8 months for T -DM1  (95% CI: 5.6- 8.2) as assessed by blinded independent central \nreview (BICR). Confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 78.5% in the ENHERTU arm  with  21.1% of \npatients demonstrating  a complete response (CR) versus an ORR of 35.0% in the T -DM1 arm where 9.5% of \npatients achieved  a CR. The median duration of response (DoR) was 36.6 months in the ENHERTU arm and \n23.8 months  in the T -DM1 arm . \n The safety profile observed with ENHERTU in DESTINY -Breast03 was consistent with previous clinical \ntrials with no new safety concerns identified. Grade 3 or higher treatment -related treatment emergent adverse \nevents (TEAEs) occurred in 47.1% of patients re ceiving ENHERTU. The most common grade 3 or higher \ntreatment -related TEAEs  in the ENHERTU arm were decreased neutrophil count (16.0%), anemia (9.3%), \ndecreased platelet count (7.8%), nausea (7.0%), decreased white blood cell count (6.2%) and fatigue (5.8%) . \nIn the ENHERTU arm , 15.2% of patients (n=39) experienced interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis \nrelated to treatment  as determined by an independent adjudication committee. The majority of  ILD or \npneumonitis events were low grad e (grade 1 or grad e 2) with two grade 3 events and no grade 4 or grade 5 \nevents  observed  in patients treated with ENHERTU.  \n \n“The overall survival benefits shown in both the DESTINY -Breast03 and DESTINY -Breast02 trials further \nvalidate the role of ENHERTU  in potentially extending the lives of  patients with previously treated HER2 \npositive breast cancer ,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “Additionally, median \nprogression- free survival was four times longer with one in five patients showing no detectab le signs of \ndisease when treated with ENHERTU compared to T -DM1 in DESTINY- Breast03, which is particularly \nimpressive in the metastatic setting of HER2 positive breast cancer. ”\n3 \n “The updated results for DESTINY -Breast03 showing that ENHERTU extends  patients’ lives and also \ndelay s progression by nearly two years reinforces our belief that this medicine  has the potential to set a new \nstandard of care for patients with HER2  positive metastatic breast cancer treated in the second -line setting ,” \nsaid Sus an Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. \n“Complemented by DESTINY -Breast02, we now have two phase 3 trials in HER2 positive metastatic breast \ncancer showing patients in these trials  have more disease -free time and live longer when they receive \nENHERTU versus the previous  standard of care .”  \n \nAll patients in DESTINY -Breast03 received at least one prior cancer therapy, including trastuzumab \n(ENHERTU = 99.6%; T -DM1 = 99.6%) or pertuzumab (ENHERTU = 62.1%; T -DM1 = 60.1%). In the \nENHERTU arm, 41.4% of patients had received one prior line of therapy in the metastatic setting . At \nbaseline, 16.5% of patients in the ENHERTU arm and 14.8% of patients in the T -DM1 arm had a history of \nbrain metastases. As of data cut -off on July 25, 2022, 75 patients remained on treatment with ENHERTU and \n18 patients on T -DM1.  \n Summary of Updated DESTINY- Breast03 Results  \nEfficacy Measure  ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg)  \nn=261 Trastuzumab Emtansine  \n(T-DM1; 3.6 mg/kg)  \nn=263  \nMedian OS, months (95% CI)  Not reached (40.5 -NE) Not reached (34.0 -NE) \nHR=0.64 (0.47 -0.87)  p=0.0037i \nOS rate (%) (95% CI)    \n      12 months  94.1% (90.4 -96.4)  86.0% (81.1 -89.8)  \n      24 months  77.4 % (71.7 -82.1)  69.9% (63.7 -75.2)  \nMedian PFS by BICR, months \n(95% CI)  28.8 months  (22.4 -37.9)  6.8 months  (5.6-8.2) \nHR=0.33 (0.26 -0.43) p<000001i,ii \nMedian PFS 2 by investigator, \nmonths (95% CI)iii 40.5 months (40.5-NE) 25.7 months  (18.5-34.0) \nHR=0.47 (0.35 -0.62)  p=0.000001i,ii \nConfirmed ORR, % (95% CI)  78.5% (73.1 -83.4)  35.0% (29.2 -41.1)  \np<0.0001i,ii \n     CR (%)  21.1% (n=55)  9.5% (n=25)  \n     PR (%)  57.5% (n=150)  25.5% (n=67)  \n     SD (%)  18.0% (n=47)  41.8% (n=110)  \n     PD (%)  1.1% (n=3)  17.9% (n=47)  \nMedian DoR, months (95% \nCI)iv 36.6 months (22.4- NE) 23.8 months (12.6- 34.7)  \nBICR, blinded independent central review; CI, confidence interval; CR, complete response, DoR, duration of response; ORR, objective response rate; \nOS, overall survival; PD, progressive disease; PFS, progression -free survival; PFS2, second progression -free survival ; PR, partial response; SD, stable \ndisease  \ni Two-sided  \nii Nominal p value .

The median PFS for \npatients in the ENHERTU arm was 17.8 months (95% CI : 14.3- 20.8) compared to 6.9 months (95% CI : 5.5-\n8.4) for those treated with physician’s choice of therapy  as assessed by BICR. Treatment with ENHERTU \nalso showed a 34% reduction in the risk of death compared to physician’s choice of treatment (HR=0.66; \n95% CI : 0.50- 0.86; p=0.0021) with a median OS of 39.2 months with ENHERTU (95% CI : 32.7- NE) versus \n26.5 mont hs with  physician’s choice of therapy (95% CI : 21.0- NE).  \n \nThe data from DESTINY -Breast02 confirm the data seen in the DESTINY -Breast01  phase 2 trial , which \nsupported the first approvals of ENHERTU  in patients with HER2  positive metastatic breast cancer who \nreceived two or more prior anti -HER2 -based regimens.  \n The safety profile observed with ENHERTU in  DESTINY -Breast02 was consistent with previous clinical \ntrials with no new saf ety concerns identified.  Grade 3 or higher treatment -related TEAEs occurred in 41.3% \nof patients receiving ENHERTU. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment -related TEAEs in the \nENHERTU arm were decreased neutrophil count (10.6%), anemia (7.9%), neutrop enia (7.7%), nausea \n(6.7%) and asthenia (5.0%). In the ENHERTU arm, 10.4% of patients (n=42) experienced ILD  or \npneumonitis related to treatment as determined by an independent adjudication committee. The majority of \nILD or pneumonitis events were low grade (grade 1 or grade 2) , with three grade 3 events, no grade 4 events \nand two grade 5 events observed.  \n About DESTINY- Breast03  \nDESTINY -Breast03 is a global, head -to-head, randomized, open- label, pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) versus T -DM1 in patients with HER2 positive unresectable \nand/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane. The primary efficacy \nendpoint of DESTINY -Breast03 is PFS based on BICR. OS  is a key secondary efficacy outcome measure. \nOther s econdary endpoints include ORR, DoR , PFS based on investigator assessment  and safety . DESTINY -\nBrea st03 enrolled 524 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and South America. \nPrimary r esults from DESTINY -Breast03 were published in The  New England Journal of Medicine , with \nupdated OS results published in The Lancet .\n For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov .\n5 \n About DESTINY- Breast02   \nDESTINY -Breast02 is a global, randomized, open- label, pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and \nsafety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) versus physician’s choice of treatment (trastuzum ab/capecitabine or \nlapatinib/capecitabine) in patients with HER2 positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer \npreviously treated with T -DM1. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either ENHERTU or physician’s \nchoice of treatment. The primary endpoint of DESTINY -Breast02 is PFS based on BICR. The key secondary \nendpoint is OS. Other s econdary endpoints include ORR based on BICR and investigator assessment, DoR \nbased on BICR, PFS based on investigator assessment and safety. DESTINY -Breast02 enrolled \napproximately 600 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and South America.  \nFor more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.  \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.1 More than two million breast cancer cases were diagnosed in 2020, with nearly 685, 000 deaths \nglobally.1 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.2 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers.3 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a \nresult of HER2  gene amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in \nbreast cancer.4  \n Despite initial treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane, patients wi th HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer \nwill often experience disease progression.\n5,6  \n About ENHERTU ENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan, fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU  is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most adva nced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor \npayload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approv ed in more than 35 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior \n \nanti-HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial. ENHERTU   also is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult\n6 \n patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior \nanti-HER2 -based regimens based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Brazil and the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 low (immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+ or IHC 2+/ in-situ hybridization \n(ISH) -) breast cancer  who have received a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed \ndisease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved under accelerated approval in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected \nby a F DA-approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy based on the results from the \nDESTINY -Lung02 trial. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and \ndescription of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n ENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the r esults from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.  \n ENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo -Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see the acc ompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide . \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU  \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  \n \nRegulatory applications for ENHERTU in breast and gastric cancer are currently under review in several \ncountries.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi San kyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the \nmanufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.\n7 \n ENHERTU U.S. Important Safety Information  \n \nIndications  \n \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based \nregimen either:  \n– In the metastatic setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six \nmonths of completing therapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -\napprov ed test, who have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease \nrecurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activat ing HER2 \n(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA -approved test, and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this i ndication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen  \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embr yo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n Warnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Cons ider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose one lev el. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroi d treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.\n8 \n Metastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients wi th metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, ILD \noccurred in 12% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 1.0% of patients treated \nwith ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 5  months (rang e: 0.9 to 23). \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onse t was 2.8  months (range: \n1.2 to  21). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Gr ade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC \n<1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast  Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a \ndecrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Sixteen percent had Grade  3 or 4 decreased \nneutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 days (range: 2  to 664). \nFebrile neutropenia was reported in 1.1% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty- one percent had \nGrade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LV EF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45%  and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment \nwithin 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40- 45% and absolute de crease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from \nbaseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume \ntreatment with ENHERTU  at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is \n>20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanen tly \ndiscontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU \nhas not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to \ninitiation of treatment.  \n Metastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \nLVEF decrease was reported in 3.6% of patients, of which 0.4% were Grade  3.\n9 \n Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% we re found to have asymptomatic Grade  2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to us e effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in 984 \npatients in Study DS8201- A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -\nBreast04, and DESTINY -Lung02.

Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were vomiting, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, pyrexia, and \nurinary tract infection. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients including COVID -19 \nand sudden death (one patient each).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 14% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis accounted for 8%. \nDose inter ruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, pneumonia, nausea, fatigue, and ILD/pneu monitis. Dose reductions occurred in 21% of \npatients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction \nwere nausea, neutropenia, and fatigue.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnor malities, were nausea (76%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (70%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (67%), decreased hemoglobin (64%), decreased lymphocyte count (55%), increased alanine \naminotransferase (53%), decre ased platelet count (52%), fatigue (49%), vomiting (49%), increased blood \nalkaline phosphatase (49%), alopecia (37%), hypokalemia (35%), constipation (34%), musculoskeletal pain\n10 \n (31%), diarrhea (29%), decreased appetite (29%), respiratory infection (22%), headache (22%), abdominal pain \n(21%), increased blood bilirubin (20%), and stomatitis (20%).  \n HER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nDESTINY- Breast04  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 371 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ \nor IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in \nDESTINY -Breast04. The median duration of treatment was 8  months (range: 0.2 to  33) for patients who \nreceived ENHERTU.  \n Serious adverse reactions occurred in 28% of patient s receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were ILD/pneumonitis, pneumonia, dyspnea, musculoskeletal \npain, sepsis, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypercalcemia, nausea, pyrexia, and vomiting. Fatalities due to \nadve rse reactions occurred in 4% of patients including ILD/pneumonitis (3 patients); sepsis (2  patients); and \nischemic colitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, dyspnea, febrile neutropenia, general physical \nhealth deterioration, pleural effusion, and r espiratory failure (1  patient each).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 16% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis accounted for 8%. \nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 39% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent advers e reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, fatigue, anemia, \nleukopenia, COVID -19, ILD/pneumonitis, increased transaminases, and hyperbilirubinemia. Dose reductions \noccurred in 23% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most freque nt adverse reactions (>2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (76%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (70%), dec reased hemoglobin (64%), decreased neutrophil count (64%), \ndecreased lymphocyte count (55%), fatigue (54%), decreased platelet count (44%), alopecia (40%), vomiting (40%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (38%), increased alanine aminotransferase (36%) , constipation \n(34%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (34%), decreased appetite (32%), musculoskeletal pain (32%), \ndiarrhea (27%), and hypokalemia (25%).  \n \nUnresectable or Metastatic HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nDESTINY -Lung02 evaluated two dose level s (5.4 mg/kg [n=101] and 6.4 mg/kg [n=50]); however, only the \nresults for the recommended dose of 5.4  mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks are described below due to \nincreased toxicity observed with the higher dose in patients with NSCLC, including ILD/pneumonitis.  \n \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 101 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -mutant \nNSCLC who received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every three weeks in DESTINY -Lung02. \nNineteen percent of patients were exposed for >6 months.  \n \nSeriou s adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were ILD/pneumonitis, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, nausea, \npleural effusion, and increased troponin I. Fatality occurred in 1 patient with suspected ILD/pneumonitis \n(1%).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 8% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent \ndiscontinuation of ENHERTU were  ILD/pneumonitis, diarrhea, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, \nmyocarditis, and vomiting. Dose interruptions of ENHERTU due to adverse reactions occurred in 23% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose interruption (>2%) included neutropenia and \nILD/pneumonitis. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occ urred in 11% of patients. \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (61%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (60%), decreased hemoglobin (58%), decreased neutrophil count (52%), \ndecreased lymphocyte count (43 %), decreased platelet count (40%), decreased albumin (39%), increased \naspartate aminotransferase (35%), increased alanine aminotransferase (34%), fatigue (32%), constipation\n11 \n (31%), decreased appetite (30%), vomiting (26%), increased alkaline phosphatase ( 22%), and alopecia \n(21%).   \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2- positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in DESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intrav enously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly or \npaclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) for pa tients who received ENHERTU.  \n Serious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jau ndice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in \n2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred \nin one patient each (0.8%).  \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutr openia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent advers e reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased hemoglobin \n(75%), decreased white  blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (72%), decreased lymphocyte count \n(70%), decreased platelet count (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (58%), fatigue (55%), increased blood alkaline phospha tase (54%), increased alanine \naminotransferase (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), increased \nblood bilirubin (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \n Use in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal  harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. \n• Lactati on: There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can c ause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproduct ive potential to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been esta blished in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 883 patients with breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 \nyears and 3.6% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade \n3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (60%) as compared to younger patients (48%). \nOf the 101 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -mutant NSCLC tre ated with ENHERTU \n5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety \nwere observed between patients ≥65  years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with\n12 \n locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU \n6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences \nin efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established  for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor. The recommended dosage of \nENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times \nULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fd a.gov/medwatch.  \n  Please see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout  Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our world-\nclass science and technology for our purpose  “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the \nworld.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular disease, Daiichi \nSankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as wel l as other diseases \nwith high unmet medical needs.

    "content": "Press Release  \nENHERTU® Approved in Japan for Patients with Previously Treated \nHER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer \n• Approval broadens indication for ENHERTU to earlier use  in metastatic breast cancer and requirement \nfor confirmatory phase 3 trial as part of conditional early approval system is complete   \n• Based on groundbreaking DESTINY -Breast03 results where  ENHERTU demonstrated a 72% reduction \nin the risk of disease progression or death versus trastuzumab emtansine (T -DM1) \n \nTokyo – ( November 24, 2022)  – Daiichi Sankyo ( TSE: 4568) today announced that ENHERTU® \n(trastuzumab deruxtecan ) has been  approved in Japan for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive \nunresectable or recurrent breast cancer after prior chemotherapy, which includes trastuzumab and a taxane.  \n \nThe approval by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) was based on the results of the \nDESTINY -Breast03  trial where  ENHERTU  demonstrated a 72% reduction in the risk of disease progression \nor death compared to trastuzumab emtansine (T- DM1) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28; 95% confidence interval \n[CI]: 0.22-0.37; p<0.000001) in patients with HER2  positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer \npreviously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane. The median progression -free survival (PFS) for patients \ntreated with ENHERTU  was not reached (95% CI: 18.5- NE) compared to 6.8 months for T -DM1 (95% CI: \n5.6-8.2) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR).  \n Data from DESTINY- Breast03 has met  the requirement for a confirmatory phase 3 trial as part of the \nconditional early approval received in Japan in March 2020.  \n  “We a re proud of the quality and speed in which we were able to deliver a confirmatory phase 3 trial that \ndemonstrated the superiority of ENHERTU in prolonging progression- free survival compared to T -DM1 in \npatients with previously treated HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer,\n” said Wataru Takasaki, PhD, \nExecutive Officer, Head of R&D Division in Japan, Daiichi Sankyo. “ This approval by the MHLW \nhighlights the importance of the conditional approval system in Japan that allows for early approval of \nmedicines to treat serious conditions such as breast cancer.”   \n \nEfficacy and safety of ENHERTU in patients without prior trastuzumab and a taxane, or as a neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, has not been established. ENHERTU is approved in Japan with a Warning for Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD). As cases of ILD, including fatal cases, have occurred in ENHERTU -treated patients,\n2 \n  \nENHERTU is to be used in close collaboration with a respiratory disease expert. Closely observe patients during therapy by monitor ing for early signs or symptoms of ILD (such as dyspnea, cough or fever) and  \nregularly perform peripheral artery oxygen saturation (SpO2) tests, chest X- ray scans and chest CT scans.    \nIf abnormalities are observed, discontinue administration of ENHERTU, and take appropriate measures such \nas corticosteroid administration. Prior to initiation of ENHERTU therapy, perform a chest CT scan and \ninterview to confirm the absence of any comorbidity or history of ILD with the patient and carefully consider the elig ibility of the patient for ENHERTU therapy.  \n The safety profile of ENHERTU in DESTINY -Breast03 was consistent with previous clinical trials with no \nnew safety concerns identified.  The most common adverse reactions included nausea (72.8%), fatigue \n(44.7%), vomiting (44.0%), decreased neutrophil count (42.8%), alopecia (36.2%), anemia (30.4%) and \ndecreased leucocyte count (30.0%). Interstitial lung disease occurred in 22.2% of Japanese patients.   \n \nAbout DESTINY- Breast03   \nDESTINY -Breast03 is a global, head -to-head, randomized, open-label, pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) versus T-DM1 in patients with HER2 positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane. The primary efficacy \nendpoint of DESTINY- Breast03 is  PFS based on BICR . Overall survival  was a key secondary efficacy \noutcome measure. Other s econdary endpoints include objective response rate , duration of response, PFS \nbased  on investigator assessment  and safety .   \n DESTINY -Breast03 enrolled 524 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and \nSouth America , including 68  patients from Japan . Results from DESTINY -Breast03 were  published in      \nThe New England Journal of Medicine .

Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU  is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. ENHERTU  consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor \npayload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 35 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior \n \nanti-HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy based on the results from \nthe DESTINY -Breast03  trial. ENHERTU  also is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 -based regimens based on th e results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Brazil  and the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 low (immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+ or IHC 2+/ in-situ hybridization \n(ISH) -) breast cancer  who  have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease \nrecurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on t he results from the \nDESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved under accelerated approval in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC ) whose tumors have activating HER2 \n(ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected by a FDA -approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy \nbased on the results from  the DESTINY -Lung02 trial.  Continued approval for this indication may be \ncontingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.   ENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the r esults from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.\n4 \n  \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program A comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU  \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers.

Brasó -\nMa ristany  P5-02-31 Poster Presentation  \nThursday, December 8, 2022  \n5:00 pm CT  \n \n \nAbout the DXd ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo  \nThe DXd ADC portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo currently consists of five ADCs in clinical development across \nmultiple types of cancer. The company’s three lead ADCs include ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato- DXd), a TROP2 directed ADC,  which are being jointly developed and \ncommercialized globally with AstraZeneca; and patritumab deruxtecan (HER3 -DXd), a HER3 directed ADC. \nTwo additional ADCs including ifinatamab deruxtecan (I -DXd; DS -7300) , a B7 -H3 directed ADC,  and DS -\n6000, a CDH6  directed ADC,  are being d eveloped through a strategic early -stage research collaboration with \nSarah Cannon Research Institute.  \n Each ADC is designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology to target and deliver a \ncytotoxic payload inside cancer cells that express a specific cell surface antigen.  Each ADC consists of a \nmonoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads ( an exatecan derivative,  DXd)  \nvia tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker s. \n Datopotamab deruxtecan , ifinatamab deruxtecan , patritumab deruxtecan  and DS -6000 are investigational \nmedicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been \nestablished. \n \nENHERTU U.S. Important Safety Information  \n Indications  \n \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:\n5 \n • Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen \neither:  \n– In the metastat ic setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months \nof completing therapy \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer, as determined by an FDA -\napproved test,  who have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease \nrecurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 \n(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA -approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for  this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen  \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in all \npatients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately \nreport symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \nContraindications None.  Warnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher  incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms  of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, \nthen if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomati c ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual \ntaper for at least 4 weeks.  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, ILD \noccurred in 12% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 1.0% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 5  months (range: 0.9 to 23). \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)\n6 \n In patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastr ic or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: \n1.2 to 21). \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERT U. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. For \nGrade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 10\n9/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a \ndecrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Sixteen percent had Grade  3 or 4 decreased \nneutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 days (range: 2 to 664). Febrile \nneutropenia was reported in 1.1% of patients.  \n \nLoca lly Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty- one percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 days \n(range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \n Left Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may b e at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during tre atment as clinically \nindicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease \nfrom baseline is 10- 20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and absolute decrease \nfrom baseline is <10%, continue  treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When \nLVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10- 20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF \nassessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue \nENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same \ndose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF \nassessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of < 40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, \npermanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of c linically \nsignificant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, LVEF \ndecrease w as reported in 3.6% of patients, of which 0.4% were Grade  3. \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on echocardiography, \n8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade  2 decrease in LVEF.  \n Embryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus.  Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. \nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months after\n7 \n the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective \ncontraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia For Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in 984 \npatients in Study DS8201-A- J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -\nBreast04, and DESTINY -Lung02. Among these patients 65% were exposed for >6 months and 39% were \nexposed for >1 year. In this pooled safety population, the most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including \nlaboratory abnormalities, were nausea (76%), decreased white blood cell count (71%), decreased hemoglobin \n(66%), decreased neutrophil count (65%), decreased lymphocyte count (55%), fatigue (54%), decreased platelet \ncount (47%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (48%), vomiting (44%), incr eased alanine aminotransferase \n(42%), alopecia (39%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (39%), constipation (34%), musculoskeletal pain \n(32%), decreased appetite (32%), hypokalemia (28%), diarrhea (28%), and respiratory infection (24%).  \n \nHER2 -Positive M etastatic Breast Cancer  \nDESTINY -Breast03  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 257 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast \ncancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every three weeks in DESTINY-Breast03. The median duration of treatment was 14 months (range: 0.7 to 30).  \n Serious adverse reactions occurred in 19% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were vomiting, interstitial lun g disease, pneumonia, pyrexia, and urinary \ntract infection. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients including COVID -19 and sudden \ndeath (one patient each).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 14% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis accounted for 8%. \nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, pneumonia, nausea, fatigue, and ILD/pneumonitis. Dose reductions occurred in 21% of \npatients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction \nwere nausea, neutropenia, and fatigue.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse r eactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (76%), decreased \nwhite blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (70%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (67%), \ndecreased hemoglobin (64%), decreased lymphocyte count (55%), increased a lanine aminotransferase (53%), \ndecreased platelet count (52%), fatigue (49%), vomiting (49%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (49%), alopecia (37%), hypokalemia (35%), constipation (34%), musculoskeletal pain (31%), diarrhea (29%), decreased appetite (29%), respiratory infection (22%), headache (22%), abdominal pain (21%), increased blood bilirubin \n(20%), and stomatitis (20%).  \n \nHER2 -Low Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nDESTINY -Breast04  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 371 patients with unresectable or me tastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or \nIHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in DESTINY -\nBreast04. The median duration of treatment was 8 months (range: 0.2 to 33) for patients who received \nENHERTU.\n8 \n  \nSerious adverse rea ctions occurred in 28% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% \nof patients who received ENHERTU were ILD/pneumonitis, pneumonia, dyspnea, musculoskeletal pain, sepsis, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypercalcemia, nausea, pyrexia, and  vomiting. Fatalities due to adverse reactions \noccurred in 4% of patients including ILD/pneumonitis (3 patients); sepsis (2  patients); and ischemic colitis, \ndisseminated intravascular coagulation, dyspnea, febrile neutropenia, general physical health deterioration, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure (1 patient each).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 16% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis accounted for 8%. \nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 39% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, fatigue, anemia, \nleukopenia, COVID -19, ILD/pneumonitis, increased transaminases, and hyperbilirubinemia. Dose reductions \noccurred in 23% of patients  treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with \ndose reduction were fatigue, nausea, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (76%), decreased \nwhite blood cell count (70%), decreased hemoglobin (64%), decreased neutrophil count (64%), decreased lymphocyte count (55%), fatigue (54%), decreased platelet count (44%), alopecia (40%), vomiting (40%), \nincreased aspartate aminotransferase (38% ), increased alanine aminotransferase (36%), constipation (34%), \nincreased blood alkaline phosphatase (34%), decreased appetite (32%), musculoskeletal pain (32%), diarrhea \n(27%), and hypokalemia (25%).  \n \nUnresectable or Metastatic HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/ kg) \nDESTINY- Lung02 evaluated two dose levels (5.4 mg/kg [n=101] and 6.4 mg/kg [n=50]); however, only the \nresults for the recommended dose of 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks are described below due to \nincreased toxicity observed with the higher dose in patients with NSCLC, including ILD/pneumonitis.  \n \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 101 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -mutant NSCLC \nwho received ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every three weeks  in DESTINY- Lung02. Nineteen percent of \npatients were exposed for >6 months.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% \nof patients who received ENHERTU were ILD/pneumonitis, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, nausea, pleural \neffusion, and increased troponin I. Fatality occurred in 1 patient with suspected ILD/pneumonitis (1%).  \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 8% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of ENHERTU were  ILD/pneumonitis, diarrhea, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, myocarditis, \nand vomiting. Dose interruptions of ENHERTU due to adverse reactions occurred in 23% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose interruption (>2%) included neutropenia and ILD/pneumonitis. Dose reductions \ndue to an adverse reaction occurred in 11% of patients.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (61%), decreased \nwhite blood cell count (60%) , decreased hemoglobin (58%) , decreased neutrophil count (52%) , decrea sed \nlymphocyte count (43%) , decreased platelet count (40%) , decreased albumin (39%), increased aspartate \naminotransferase (35%) , increased alanine aminotransferase (34%) , fatigue (32%) , constipation (31%), \ndecreased appetite ( 30%), vomiting (26%), increased alkaline phosphatase (22%), and alopecia (21%) .   \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric \nor GEJ adenocarcinoma in DE STINY -Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of either \nENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly or paclitaxel \n(N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: 0.7 to 22.3) for \npatients who received ENHERTU.\n9 \n  \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse reactions \nin >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, pneumonia, \ncholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred in one patient each (0.8%).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions \ndue to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interrupti on were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, leukopenia, fatigue, \nthrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most fr equent adverse reactions (>2%) \nassociated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions , including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased hemoglobin \n(75%), decreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (72%), decreased lymphocyte count (70%), decreased platelet count (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (58%), fatigue (55%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (54%), increased alanine \naminotransferase (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), increased \nblood bilirubin (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \n Use in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the \npotential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed \nchild, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause fetal \nharm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contracepti on during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : Advise male \npatients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function \nand fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 883 patients with breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, 22% wer e ≥65 \nyears and 3.6% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 \nadverse reactions observed in patients a ged ≥65 years (60%) as compared to younger patients (48%). Of the \n101 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, 40% \nwere ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75  years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between \npatients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with locally advanced or \nmetastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -\nGastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥ 75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were \nobserved between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with \nmoderate renal imp airment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairme nt, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor. The recommended dosage of \nENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN\n10 \n and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or FDA  \nat 1- 800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n  \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout  Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our world-\nclass science and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the  \nworld.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular disease, Daiichi  \nSankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as well as other diseases  \nwith high unmet  medical needs.

    "content": "Press  Release  \n \nENHERTU® Recommended for Approv al in the EU  by CHMP for \nPatients with Previously Treated HER2 Positive Advanced Gastric \nCancer \n \n• Based on DESTINY -Gastric0 2, which  showed Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s  ENHERTU  \ndemonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy  and DESTINY- Gastric01 , which showed improved overall \nsurvival compared to chemotherapy \n \nTokyo and Munich  – (November  14, 20 22) – Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568 ) and AstraZeneca’s  \n(LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) ENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan) has been recommended for approval  in the \nEuropean Union (EU) as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced HER2 positive \ngastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based \nregimen.  \n \nENHERTU  is a specifically engineered HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly \ndeveloped and commercialized  by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca.  \n The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA)  \nbased its positive opinion on results from the DESTINY -Gastric02  and the DESTINY- Gastric01  phase 2 \ntrials.   \n \nIn DESTINY -Gastric02, conducted in patients from North America and Europe, updated results showed \ntreatment with ENHERTU  resulted in  a confirmed objective response rate ( ORR ) of 41.8% (95% confidence \ninterval [ CI]: 30.8-53.4) as assessed by independent central review  (ICR) . Median duration of response \n(DoR) was 8.1 months ( 95% CI : 5.9- NE). Median overall survival ( OS) was  12.1 months ( 95% CI : 9.4-\n15.4). Primary results from the DESTINY -Gastric02 phase 2 trial were  presented  at the 2021 European \nSociety for Medical Oncology (ESMO)  Congress with updated data presented at ESMO 2022.  \n \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01 , conducted in patients from Japan and South Korea, treatment with ENHERTU  \nresulted in  an ORR of 51.3% (95% CI: 41.9-60.5) versus 14.3% ( 95% CI : 6.4-26.2) with chemotherapy  \n(irinotecan or paclitaxel)  as assessed by ICR  (p<0.0001). Confirmed ORR , a major efficacy outcome, was \n42.0% (95% CI: 33.0-51.4) with ENHERTU versus 12.5% (95% CI: 5.2-24.1) with chemotherapy as \nassessed  by ICR. P atients treated with ENHERTU also had a 40% reduction in the risk of death versus \npatients treated with chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.42- 0.86, p=0.01)  with a m edian OS\n2 \n of 12.5 months (95% CI: 10.3-15.2) versus 8.9 months (95% CI: 6.4-10.4). The primary analysis was \npublished in The New England Journal of Medicine , with updated data presented at the 2021 American \nSociety of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual M eeting . \n \nThe recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission, which has the authority to grant  \nmarketing authorizations for medicines in the EU . \n \n“ENHERTU  is the first HER2 directed medicine to demonstrate a significant improvement in overall \nsurvival compared to chemotherapy in patients with gastric cancer following initial treatment  with a HER2 \ndirected medicine in the advanced or metastatic setting ,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, \nDaiichi Sankyo . “The CHMP opinion recognizes the high unmet need in this patient population and brings us \none step closer to bringing this medicine  to patients with gastric cancer in Europe.”   \n “Gastric cancer is usually diagnosed in the advanced stage in many European countries and patients face \nhigh mortality rates ,” said  Susan Galbraith, MBBCh , PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, \nAstraZeneca. “If approved, ENHERTU  would be the first HER2 directed medicine for patients with \nadvanced gastric cancer  in the European Union in more than a decade.”  \n \nIn DESTINY -Gastric02, the safety profile observed  with patients treated with ENHERTU was consistent \nwith that seen in other trials of ENHERTU with no new safety signals identified. Grade 3 or higher \ntreatment -emergent adverse events (TEAE s) occurred in 55.7% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. \nThe most common grade  3 or higher treatment- related TEAEs occurring in ≥10% of patients receiving \nENHERTU was anemia (13.9%) . There were eight  cases ( 10.1%) of treatment -related interstitial lung \ndisease (ILD) or pneumonitis as determined by an independent adjudication committee. The majority ( six) \nwere low grade (grade 1 or 2), with two grade 5 ILD or pneumonitis events reported . \n \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01 , the safety profile observed in patients treated with ENHERTU was consistent with \nthat seen in other trials of ENHERTU with no new safety signals identified. Grade 3 or higher TEAEs \noccurred in 85.6% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. The most common grade 3 or higher \ntreatment -related TEAEs  occurring in ≥20% of patients  receiving ENHERTU  were decreased neutrophil \ncount (51.2%), anemia (38.4%)  and decreased white blood cell count (20.8%). There were 16 cases ( 12.8%) \nof treatment -related ILD or pneumonitis as determined by an independent adjudication committee. The \nmajority (13) were low grade  (grade 1 or 2), with two grade 3 events and one grade 4 event  reported. No \ngrade 5 ILD or pneumonitis events occurred .\n3 \n ENHERTU is not currently approved in the EU for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer and is subject to \nadditional monitoring.  \n About DESTINY- Gastric02  \nDESTINY -Gastric02 is an open- label, single -arm phase 2 trial in Western patients evaluating the efficacy \nand safety of ENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) in patients with HER2 positive\n metastatic and/or unresectable gastric \nor GEJ adenocarcinoma with disease progression on or after a trastuzuma b-containing regimen.  \n The primary endpoint of DESTINY -Gastric02 is confirmed ORR based on ICR . Secondary endpoints \ninclude progression -free survival ( PFS) , OS, DoR and safety.  \n DESTINY -Gastric02 enrolled 79 patients at multiple sites in North America an d Europe. For more \ninformation about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout DESTINY- Gastric01  \nDESTINY -Gastric01 is a randomized, open- label phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of \nENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg)  in patients from Japan and South Korea with primarily HER2 positive (defined as \nimmunohistochemistry ( IHC) 3+ or IHC  2+/in-situ hybridization ( ISH)+) advanced gastric cancer or GEJ  \nadenocarcinoma who se tumors  have progressed on two or more prior treatment regimens including \nfluoropyrimidine (5- FU), platinum chemotherapy and trastuzumab. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive \nENHERTU  or physician’s choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel or irinotecan monothe rapy).  \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY -Gastric01  is ORR . Secondary endpoints include OS , PFS, DoR , disease \ncontrol rate and time to treatment failure , as well as pharmacokinetic and safety endpoints.   \n DESTINY -Gastric01 enrolled 187 patients at multiple sites in Japan and South Korea. For more information \nabout the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Gastric Cancer  \nGastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the fourth highest leading cause of cancer mortality, with a five -year global survival rate of 5% to 10% for advanced or metastatic disease.\n1,2,3 \nApproximately one million new patients were diagnosed with gastric cancer  in 2020, with 768,000 deaths \nreported globally.4 In Europe, approximately 136,000 cases of gastric cancer are diagnosed annually, and \nEastern Europe has the second highest incidence of gastric cancer worldwide after Eastern Asia.3,4 Gastri c \ncancer is the  sixth leading cause of cancer death in Europe  and is typically diagnosed in the advanced stage . \nEven when diagnosed in earlier stages  of the disease, the survival rate remains modest.2,5,6\n4 \n  \nApproximately one in five gastric cancers are HER2 positive.7,8 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth \npromoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including breast, gastric, lung and \ncolorectal cancers.7 HER2  overexpression may be associated with a specific HER2 gene alteration known as \nHER2 amplification.8 \n \nRecommended first -line treatment for HER2 positive advanced or metastatic gastric cancer is combination \nchemotherapy plus trastuzumab, an anti -HER2 medicine, which has been shown to improve survival \noutcomes when added to chemotherapy.9,10 For patients with metastatic gastric cancer that progress es \nfollowing initial treatment with a trastuzumab -based regimen, treatment options are limited, and in many \nregions of  the world there are no additional HER2 directed medicines available.1,11,12 \n About ENHERTU   \nENHERTU  (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU  is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU  consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor \npayload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in mor e than 35 countries for the treatment of adult patients  with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior  \nanti-HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant sett ing, and have \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy based on the results from \nthe DESTINY -Breast03  trial. ENHERTU  also is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior \nanti-HER2 -based regimens based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Brazil and  the U.S.  for the treatment of  adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or  IHC 2+/ ISH-) breast cancer  who have received a prior \nchemotherapy in th e metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy  based on the results from  the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved under accelerated approval  in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 \n(ERBB2 ) mutation s, as detected by an FDA -approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy\n5 \n based on the results of the DESTINY -Lung02 trial.  Continued approval for this indication may be contingent \nupon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the r esults from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU  Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU  \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer tre atments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n Regulatory applications for ENHERTU  in breast  and gastric cancer are currently under review in several \ncountries based on the DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -Breast04 , DESTINY -Gastric01 \nand D ESTINY -Gastric02 trials, respectively.  \n About the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca  Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU  in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU  and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n About Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our world-class science and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around t he \nworld.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular disease, Daiichi Sankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as well as other diseases with high unmet medical needs.

Results will be presented today as a late \nbreaking presentation ( LBA55 ) at the European Society for Medical Oncology (#ESMO22) 2022 Congress.  \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly \ndeveloped and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo (TSE:4568) and AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN).   \n \nAt a pre -specified interim analysis of DESTINY -Lung02, with a  data cutoff of March 24, 2022 , patients \nreceiving ENHERTU  at a dose of 5.4 mg/kg (n=52 ) or 6.4 mg/kg ( n=28 ) demonstrated clinically meaningful \nactivity . The safety profile for both doses also was consistent with the  overall safety  profile of ENHERTU  \nwith the 5.4 mg/kg dose demonstrating a favorable safety profile in this patient population . A c onfirmed \nobjective response rate (ORR)  of 53.8% (95% confidence interval [CI ], 39.5-67.8) and 42.9% (95% CI, 24.5-\n62.8) was seen in  the 5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg arms , respectively , as assessed by blinded independent central \nreview (BICR) . One complete response (CR) was observed in each arm (5.4 mg/kg: 1.9%, 6.4 mg/kg : 3.6%) \nwith 27 (51.9%) partial responses (PR) observed in the 5.4 mg/ kg arm  and 11 (39.3%) PRs observed in the \n6.4 mg/kg arm . At the pre -specified interim analysis, a median  duration of response (DoR) was not reached \nin the 5.4 mg/kg arm and a median DoR of 5.9 months (95% CI: 2.8-NE) was seen in the 6.4 mg/kg arm. A s \nmedian DoR was not reached in the 5.4 mg/kg arm , an additional 90- day follow -up response analysis was \nconducted, with a data cutoff of June 22, 2022, where ENHERTU demonstrated a confirmed ORR of 57.7% \n(95% CI, 43.2-71.3) and a median DoR of 8.7 months (95% CI: 7.1 -NE) with CRs seen in 1.9% of patients \nand PRs in 55.8% of patients.\n2 \n “DESTINY -Lung02 reinforces HER2 as  an actionable mutation in patients with metastatic non- small cell \nlung cancer and further demonstrates that  ENHERTU  provides a clinically meaningful tumor response for \nthese patients who have historically had limited treatment options ,” said Koichi Goto, MD, Medical \nOncologist and Investigator at National Cancer Center Hospital East, Kashiwa, Japan . “The response seen in \nthis tria l along with the disease control observed support  ENHERTU  as a potential treatment option  in this \ntype of non- small cell lung cancer .”  \n \nIn DESTINY -Lung02, a favorable safety profile was observed in patients treated with  ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg  \nwith no new safet y signals identified at eithe r dose. Grade 3 t reatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) \nwere higher with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg v ersus 5.4 mg/kg ( n=151). Grade 3  or higher treatment -related \nTEAEs occurred in 31.7% and 58.0% of all  patients receiving ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg, \nrespectively . The most common grade 3 or higher treatment -related TEAEs occurring in >10% of patients \nwere neutropenia (11.9% (5.4 mg/kg), 34.0% (6.4 mg/kg)), anemia ( 8.9% (5.4 mg/kg), 14.0% (6.4 mg/kg)) \nand leukopenia (2.0% (5.4 mg/kg), 14.0% (6.4 mg/kg)). There were 13 cases ( 5.9% in the 5.4 mg/kg arm  and \n14% in the 6.4 mg/kg arm ) of treatment -related ILD  or pneumonitis  reported as determined by an \nindependent adjudic ation committee . The majority (5.4 mg/kg: 5.0%, 6.4 mg/kg: 14.0%) were low grade \n(grade 1 or 2), with one grade 3 event (5.4 mg/kg: 1.0%) reported. No grade 4 or grade 5 ILD or pneumonitis \nevents occurred.   \n“The DESTINY -Lung02 results are consistent with  the data previously seen with ENHERTU in non- small \ncell lung cancer and the efficacy demonstrated in this interim analysis , which supported the recent U.S. FDA \naccelerated approval of ENHERTU in patients with HER2  mutant non -small cell lung  cancer,  reinforc es the \npotential to establish this medicine as a treatment option for these  patients ,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global \nHead, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “These data will help inform future regulatory submissions worldwide with the \ngoal of continuing to offer this innovative medicine to  as many patients as possible.”  \n \n“The clinically meaningful activity , together with the favorable safety profile  seen in  the DESTINY -Lung02 \ntrial helps establish the optimal dose of ENHERTU at 5.4 milligrams per kilogram in previously treated \nHER2  mutant non- small cell lung cancer,” said Cristian Massacesi, MD, Chief Medical Officer and \nOncology Chief Development Officer , Astra Zeneca. “As we continue to explore the potential of this \nimportant medicine  across multiple HER2 targetable tumor types , these data reaffirm the need to undertake \nHER2 testing in patients diagnosed with lung cancer.” \n \nAll p atients in DESTINY -Lung02 received at least one prior cancer therap y, including platinum -based \nchemotherapy. In the pre -specified early cohort, 71.2% and 78.6% of patients received prior anti -PD-1 \ntherapy in the 5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg arms, respectively. Median follow -up was 5.6 months (1.1- 11.7) in \nthe 5.4 mg/kg arm and 5.4 months (0.6-12.1) in the 6.4 mg/kg arm.\n3 \n  \nSummary of DESTINY- Lung02  Results  \n \nEfficacy Measure  ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg)  \nn=52  ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg)  \nn=52   \nAdditional 90 -day \nFollow -upi ENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg)  \nn=28  \nConfirmed ORR (%) \n(95% CI)ii,iii 53.8% (39.5-67.8) 57.7% (43.2-71.3) 42.9% (24.5-62.8) \n   CR (%)  1.9%  1.9%  3.6%  \n   PR (%)  51.9%  55.8%  39.3%  \n   SD (%)  36.5%   50.0%  \n   PD (%)  3.8%   3.6%  \n   NE (%)iv 5.8%   3.6%  \nDCR (95% CI) ii,v 90.4% (79.0-96.8)  92.9% ( 76.5-99.1) \nMedian DoR \n(months) (95% CI)ii NE (4.2-NE) 8.7 (7.1 -NE) 5.9 (2.8 -NE) \nMedian TTIR \n(months) (95% CI)  1.4 (1.2 -5.8)  1.4 (1.2 -3.0) \nCI, confidence interval; CR, complete response; DCR, disease control rate; DoR, duration of response;  NE, not estimable; ORR, objective response \nrate; PD, progressive disease; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease ; TTIR, time to initial response  \nData from subset of patients randomized ≥4.5 months prior to the data cut -off \ni As the median DoR  for the 5.4 mg/kg dose arm was not reached at the March 24, 2022 cutoff, an additional 90 -day follow -up response analysis was \nconducted; data cutoff for the 90 -day follow -up was June 22, 2022 \nii As assessed by blinded independent central review  \niii ORR is (CR + PR)  \niv Three patients were NE at 5.4 mg/kg (one patient never received treatment due to COVID; two patients discontinued before firs t tumor assessment); \none NE at 6.4 mg/kg (discontinued due to adverse event before first tumor assessment ).  \nv DCR is (CR + PR +  SD) \n \nDESTINY-Lung01 Updated Results  \nUpdated results  from the DESTINY -Lung01 phase 2 trial , which evaluated ENHERTU in HER2  mutant \n(cohort 2) or HER2 overexpressing (cohort 1 and cohort 1a) NSCLC, also were  presented at ESMO and \nshow ed that ENHERTU continues to demonstrate consistent efficacy , safety and survival with longer follow -\nup.   \nAfter a median follow -up of 16.7 months, results of previously- t reated  patients with  HER2 mutant NSCLC \n(cohort 2) showed the median duration of response (DoR) for ENHERTU in the overall patient population \nincreased to 10.6 months (95% CI: 5.6-18.3) with median overall survival (OS) increasing to 18.6 months \n(95% CI: 13.8-25.8). Subgroup analyses of patients with or without a presence of baseline asymptomatic \nbrain metastases showed that treatment with ENHERTU resulted in a median PFS of 7.1 months (95% CI : \n5.5-9.8) and 9.7 months (95% CI: 4.5-16.9), respectively and a median OS of 14.0 months (95% CI: 9.8-\n19.5) and 27.0 months (95% CI: 15.3-NE), respectively. The subgroup analysis of patients who had received \neither two or fewer prior therapies or more tha n two prior therapies showed a median PFS of 8.3 months \n(95% CI: 5.8- 15.2) and 6.8 months (95% CI: 4.4- 9.8), respectively and a median OS of 22.1 months (95% \nCI: 14.0-31.3) and 13.8 months (95% CI:  7.1-18.6), respectively.\n4 \n  \nAdditionally, updated results f rom cohort 1  (ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg; n=49 ) and  cohort 1a (ENHERTU 5.4 \nmg/kg; n=41), which evalua ted patients with previously- treated metastatic HER2  overexpressing NSCLC, \nhighlight encour aging anti -tumor activity . At the data cutoff of December 3, 2021, in cohort 1, a confirmed \nORR of 26.5% ( 95% CI: 15.0-41.1) was seen in patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg  with a m edian PFS \nof 5.7 months  (95% CI: 2.8-7.2) and a median OS of 12.4 months  (95% CI: 7.8-17.2). In cohort 1a, a \nconfirmed ORR  of 34.1% (95% CI: 20.1-50.6) was seen in patients receiving ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, with a \nmedian PFS of 6.7 months (95% CI: 4.2-8.4) and a median OS of 11.2 months  (95% CI: 8.4- NE). Median \nduration of follow -up was 12.0 months ( 95% CI: 0.4-36.0) and 10.6 months ( 95% CI: 0.6-16.9) in the 6.4 \nmg/kg and 5.4 mg/kg treatment groups, respectively.  \n \nThe overall safety profile of ENHERTU  in DESTINY -Lung01 was consistent with previous data , with no \nnew safety signals identified  with the longer follow -up. In the HER2  mutant NSCLC patient cohort, there \nwas one additional case of treatment-related ILD or pneumonitis observed, as determined by an independent \nadjudication committee.  ILD has been observed in 27.5% of  patients treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in \nthe HER2  mutant  cohort with the majority identified as low -grade and two grade 5 events occurring. In the \nHER2 overexpressing NSCLC patient cohorts, there were two additional cases of treatment -related ILD or \npneumonitis observed in the 6.4 mg/kg dose arm  and two cases observed in the 5.4 mg/kg dose cohort , as \ndetermined by an independent adjudication committee. ILD has been observed in 20.4% and 4.9% of patients \ntreated with ENHERTU at the 6.4 mg/kg and 5.4 mg/kg doses, respectively, in the HER2 overexpressing \ncohort with the majority identified as low -grade and four grade 5 events occurring.  Data from the DESTINY-\nLung01 phase 2 trial were  previously published in The New England Journal of Medicine . \n \nENHERTU is not approved outside the U.S. for the treatment of patients with metastatic HER2  mutant \nNSCLC.   \n About DESTINY- Lung02  \nDESTINY -Lung02 is a global, randomized phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU  in \npatients with HER2  mutant metastatic NSCLC with disease recurrence or progression during or after at least \none regimen of prior anticancer therapy that must have contained a platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg (Cohort 1; n=102) or  ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg (Cohort \n2; n= 50). The primary endpoint of the study is confirmed ORR as assessed by BICR.  Secondary endpoints \ninclude confirmed disease control rate (DCR), DoR  and PFS assessed by investigator and BICR, \ninvestigator- assessed OS and safety. DESTINY -Lung02 enrolled 152 patients at multiple sites, including \nAsia, Europe and North America.

The primary endpoint is confirmed ORR by independent central review ( ICR). Key secondary endpoints include DoR, DCR, PFS, OS \nand safety. DESTINY-Lung01 enrolled 181 patients at multiple sites, including Asia, Europe and North America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout  HER2  Mutant  and HER2  Overexpressing  NSCLC            \nLung cancer is the second most common form of cancer globally, with more than two million patients diagnosed in 2020.\n1 For patients with metastatic NSCLC , prognosis is particularly poor, as only \napproximately 8% will live beyond five years after diagnosis.2 \n HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors, including lung, breast, gastric and colorectal cancers. Certain HER2  (ERBB2 ) gene alterations (called \nHER2  mutations) have been identified in patients with non-squamous NSCLC as a distinct molecular target, \nand occur in approximately 2 to 4% of patients with this type of lung cancer.\n3,4 While HER2  gene mutations \ncan occur in a range of patients, they are more commonly found in patients with NSCLC who are younger, female and have never smoked.\n5 HER2 gene mutations have been independently associated with cancer cell \ngrowth and poor prognosis, with an increased incidence of brain metastases.6  \n \nAlthough the role of anti- HER2 treatment is well established in breast and gastric cancers, there were  no \napproved HER2 directed therapies  in NSCLC prior to the accelerated U.S. FDA approval of ENHERTU in \nunresectable or metastatic HER2  mutant NSCLC.7 Nex t-generation sequencing has been utilized in the \nidentification of HER2 ( ERBB2 ) mutations.8 \n \nHER2 overexpression is associated with a specific HER2 gene alteration known as HER2 amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poorer prognosis.\n9 It has been reported in approximately 10% \nto 15% of patients with NSCLC , with an incidence as high as 30% in those with adenocarcinoma (a subtype \nof cancer that  grows in the glands that line the insides of organs ).10,11,12,13 \n About ENHERTU ENHERTU\n® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 \ndirected ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC\n6 \n scientific platform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n ENHERTU (5.4 m g/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior \n \nanti-HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoa djuvant or adjuvant setting, and have \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial. ENHERTU also is appro ved in several countries for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior \nanti-HER2 -based regimens based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+ or IHC 2+/ in-situ hybridization (ISH) -) breast cancer \nwho have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or \nwithin six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results from the DESTI NY-Breast04  \ntrial. \n  \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved under accelerated approval in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 \n(ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected by an FDA -approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy \nbased on the results from  the DESTINY -Lung02 trial.  Continued approval for this indication may be \ncontingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERT U (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.  \n ENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see the accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication Guide . \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.\n7 \n Regulatory applications for ENHERTU in breast and gastric cancer are currently under review in several \ncountries based on the DESTINY- Breast01, DESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -Breast04, DESTINY -Gastric01 \nand DESTINY -Gastric02 trials, respectively.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the \nmanufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.  U.S. Important Safety Information \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based \nregimen either:  \n– In the metastati c setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six \nmonths of completing therapy  \n  \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH- ) breast cancer who have received a prior \nchemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 \n(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy\n \n  \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen  \n  \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY  \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue \nENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of \nthese risks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \nContraindications\n \n None.\n8 \n Warnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A hig her incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and sympt oms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptom atic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays follow ed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD \noccurred in 12% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 1.0% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 5 months (range: 0.9 to 23).\n \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive ga stric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2 to 21).\n \n  \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with E NHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, th en maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 10\n9/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level.  \n  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a \ndecrease in neu trophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Sixteen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased \nneutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 days (range: 2 to 664). \nFebrile neutropenia was reported in 1.1% of patients.  \n  \nLoca lly Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty- one perc ent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.\n \n  \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment \nwithin 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40- 45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt\n9 \n ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from \nbaseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume \ntreatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is \n>20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been stud ied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to \ninitiation of treatment.\n \n  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, \nLVEF decrease was reported in 3.6% of patients, of which 0.4% were Grade 3.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n  \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and  for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.\n \n  \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, t hen reduce  dose by one level.  \n  \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in 984 \npatients in Study DS8201-A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY- Breast01, DESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -\nBreast04, and DESTINY -Lung02.

Advise \npatients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in \npregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse\n12 \n reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during tre atment with ENHERTU and \nfor 7 months after the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of \nfemales of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 \nmonths after the last dose. Males : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the \nlast dose.  Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric \npatients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 883 patients with breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 22% were \n≥65 years and 3.6% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years  of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher \nincidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (60%) as compared to \nyounger patients (48%). Of the 101 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2- mutant NSCLC \ntreated  with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75 years. No overall \ndifferences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2- posit ive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY- Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 \nyears and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in \npatients with moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The recommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with \nsevere renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor. The \nrecommen ded dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic \nimpairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST).\n \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout  Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our world -\nclass science and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the world.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular disease, Daiichi Sankyo is primarily focused on deve loping novel therapies for people with cancer as well as other diseases \nwith high unmet medical needs.

The trial also met \nthe key secondary endpoint of improved overall survival.  \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly \ndeveloped and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZ N). \n The trial evaluated a similar later-line patient population as the single -arm DESTINY -Breast01 phase 2 trial, \nwhich is the basis for initial approvals in advanced HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer . The safety profile \nof ENHERTU was consistent with previous phase 3  clinical trials with no new safety concerns identified . \nInterstitial lung disease (ILD) rates and severity were consistent with those  observed in other metastatic  \nbreast cancer trials of ENHERTU , with a low rate of grade 5 ILD observed as determined by an independent \nadjudication committee .  \n “The topline results from DESTINY -Breast02 confirm the robust progression- free survival  seen in previous \ntrials of ENHERTU and enrich our clinical understanding of the benefit  this therapy may offer patients with \nHER2 positive metastatic breast cancer,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “ As \nthis is the confirmatory trial for our current breast cancer indication  in Europe and several other countries, we \nlook forward to sharing these findings  with regulatory authorities  to add to the body of data for  ENHERTU \nfor the treatment of HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer .”  \n “The DESTINY -Breast02 trial results in this patient population with advanced disease confirm the efficacy \nand safety profile seen  in DESTINY -Breast01 and are consistent with the results seen across our broader\n2 \n  \nclinical program in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD,  Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “The se data  further strengthen our confidence in \nENHERTU and  reinforc e its potential to transform patient outcomes across multiple treatment settings .”  \n \nThe data will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting .  \n \nAbout DESTINY- Breast02\n \nDESTINY -Breast02 is a global, randomized, open-label, pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and \nsafety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) versus physician’s choice of treatment (trastuzumab/capecitabine or lapatinib/capecitabine) in patients with\n HER2 positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer \npreviously treated with T-DM1. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either ENHERTU or physician’s choice of treatment.   \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY- Breast0 2 is PFS based on blinded independent central review ( BICR). \nThe key secondary endpoint is overall survival. Other secondary endpoint s include objective response rate \nbased on BICR and i nvestigator assessment , duration of response based on BICR, PFS based on investigator \nassessment  and safety.  \n \nDESTINY -Breast02 enrolled approximately 600 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe, North America, \nOceania and South America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.1 More than two million patients were diagnosed with  breast cancer in 2020, with nearly 685,000 \ndeaths globally.1 Approximately one in five patients with  breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.2  \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers.3 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a \nresult of HER2 gene amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in \nbreast cancer.4 \n \nAbout ENHERTU \nENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam- trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific\n3 \n  \nplatform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody at tached to a topoisomerase I  inhibitor \npayload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide- based cleavable linker.  \n ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries\n for the treatment of adult patients  with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior anti -\nHER2 -based regimen either in the metastatic setting  or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting , and have \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy based  on results from the \nDESTINY -Breast03  trial. ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) also is approved in several  countries for the treatment of \nadult patients with  unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more \nprior anti -HER2 -based regimens based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.    \n \nENHERTU ( 5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S.  for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic HER2 low ( immunohistochemistry ( IHC) 1+ or IHC 2+/ in-situ hybridization ( ISH)-) breast cancer \nwho have received a prior chemo therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or \nwithin six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results of the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.   \n ENHERTU ( 5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have act ivating  HER2  (ERBB2 ) mutation s, as \ndetected by an FDA-approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therap y based on the results of \nthe DESTINY -Lung02\n trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal jun ction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.   \n ENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal  \nToxicity. For more information, please see the accompanying full Prescribing Infor mation , including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide .  \n About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program A comprehensive development program is underway globally, evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU  monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers, including breast, gastric, lung and \ncolorectal cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer  treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also \nunderway.\n4 \n  \nRegulatory applications for ENHERTU  in breast and gastric cancer are currently under review in several  \ncountries based on the DESTINY- Breast01, DESTINY -Breast03,  DESTINY -Breast04,  DESTINY -Gastric01 \nand DESTINY -Gastric02  trials, respectively.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (referred to as Daiichi Sankyo) and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize trastuzumab deruxtecan in March 2019 and datopotamab \nderuxtecan (Dato -DXd ) in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for \neach ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of trastuz umab deruxtecan and \ndatopotamab deruxtecan. \n \nImportant Safety Information  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based \nregimen either:  \n– In the metastatic setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six \nmonths of completing therapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH- ) breast cancer who have received a prior \nchemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six  months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 \n(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test, and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcin oma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen  \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY  \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.\n5 \n  \nContraindications  \nNone.  \nWarnings and Precautions \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients with moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Cons ider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose one lev el. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroi d treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.   \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients w ith metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, ILD \noccurred in 12% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 1.0% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 5  months (ran ge: 0.9 to 23). \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first ons et was 2.8  months (range: \n1.2 to  21). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, the n reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC \n<1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a \ndecrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Sixteen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased \nneutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 days (range: 2  to 664). \nFebrile neutropenia was reported in 1.1% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gast ric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty- one percent had \nGrade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n16 days (r ange: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients. \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and\n6 \n absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment \nwithin 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40- 45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from \nbaseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume \ntreatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF asse ssment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU \nhas not been stud ied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to \ninitiation of treatment.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \nLVEF decrease was reported in 3.6% of patients, of which 0.4% were Grade 3. \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered  to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during tre atment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modif ications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in 984 \npatients in Study DS8201-A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY- Breast01, DESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -\nBreast04, and DESTINY -Lung02.

Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7  months after the last dose of ENHERTU. \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastf ed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of  ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use \neffective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 883 patients with breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 \nyears and 3.6% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy withi n clinical studies were observed \nbetween patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade \n3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (60%) as compared to younger patients (48%). \nOf the 101 patient s with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU \n5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65  years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125 patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU \n6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences \nin efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The  \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min).  \n• H epatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor. The recommended dosage of \nENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times \nULN and any AST).  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo , Inc. at 1- 877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA-1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n Please see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide.  \n \nAbout  Daiichi Sankyo\n \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our world-\nclass science and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the \nworld.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular disease, Daiichi \nSankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as well as other diseases with high unmet medical needs.

    "content": "1 \n  \nPress Release  \nENHERTU® Approved in the U.S.  as the First HER2 Directed \nTherapy for Patients with Previously Treated HER2 Mutant  \nMetastatic Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer  \n \n• Based on DESTINY -Lung02  results  which  showed Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s ENHERTU \nreported a confirmed objective response rate of 57.7% in patients with HER2  mutant disease  \n \nTokyo and Basking Ridge, NJ – (August 11, 2022) – Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and AstraZeneca’s \n(LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) ENHERTU® (fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki)  has been approved in the U.S. \nfor the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose \ntumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2 ) mutations, as detected by an FDA -approved test, and who have \nreceived a prior systemic therapy . This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective \nresponse rate (ORR) and duration of response  (DoR) . Continued approval for this indi cation may be \ncontingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \nENHERTU is a  specifically engineered  HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly \ndeveloped and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca.  \n \nThe accelerated approval by the FDA was based on the results from the DESTINY -Lung02  phase 2 trial . An \ninterim efficacy analysis in a pre -specified patient cohort showed that ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) demonstrated \na confirmed ORR of 57.7% (n=52; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4 3.2-71.3) in patients with HER2  mutant \nunresectable or metastatic non -squamous NSCLC who had received one prior systemic therapy  as assessed \nby blinded independent central review (BICR) . Complete responses  (CR)  were seen in 1. 9% of patients \n(n=1) and partial responses (PR) in 55.8% of patients (n=29) with a median duration of response of 8.7 \nmonths (95% CI: 7.1-NE).  \n \nENHERTU is the first HER2 directed medicine to be approved for the treatment of patients with HER2  \nmuta nt metastatic NSCLC. This is the third tumor type approved by the FDA for ENHERTU in three years . \nThe approval follows the recently received Priority Review , as well as the Breakthrough Therapy \nDesignation  granted in 2020 by the FDA for this speci fic type of lung cancer  based on the results of the \nDESTINY -Lung01  phase 2 trial. Results from the DESTINY -Lung02 trial will be presented at an upcoming\n2 \n medical meeting.  Concurrently with this approval, the FDA also approved companion diagnostic tests to \ndetect HER2  mutations in lung tumor tissue and plasma.  \n \n“The approval of trastuzumab  deruxtecan in non -small cell lung cancer is an important milestone for patients \nand the oncology community,” said Bob T. Li, MD, PhD, MPH, Medical Oncologist  and Physician -Scientist , \nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York. “After two decades of research into the role of \ntargeting HER2 in lung cancer, the approval of the first HER2  directed treatment option validates HER2 as \nan actionable target in lung cancer and marks an important step forward for treating this patient  population \nwith unmet medical needs .”  \n \n“The availability of ENHERTU as the first  HER2 targeted treatment option for HER2 mutant non -small cell \nlung cancer is great news for patients ,” said Upal Basu Roy, PhD, MPH, Executive Director of Research, \nLUNGevit y. “We are thrilled to see a novel treatment option available that targets this group of rare \nmutations in lung cancer. This approval is a great reminder that access to high -quality biomarker testing will \nbe critical to ensuring that patients whose tumors have HER2  mutations have access to these new therapies .” \n \nENHERTU  is approved with Boxed WARNINGS for interstitial lung disease (ILD)/ pneumonitis and \nEmbryo -Fetal toxicity. In the DESTINY -Lung02 phase 2 trial , the safety of ENHERTU was further \nevaluated in an analysis of 101 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2  mutant NSCLC  who received \nat least one recommended dose of ENHERTU ( 5.4 mg/kg) . The most common adverse reactions (frequency \n≥20%), including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea, decreased white blood cell c ount, decreased \nhemoglobin, decreased neutrophil count, decreased lymphocyte count, decreased platelet count,  \ndecreased albumin, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased alanine aminotransferase, fatigue, \nconstipation, decreased appetite, vomiting, increased alkaline phosphatase, and alopecia . Serious adverse \nreactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were ILD/pneumonitis, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, \nnausea, pleural effusion, and increased troponin I . Fatality occurred in one patient with suspected \nILD/pneumonitis (1%).  Increased rates of ILD/pneumonitis were observed at a higher dose.   \n \n“We are excited that the FDA has granted accelerated approval for ENHERTU for patients with HER2 \nmutant metastatic n on-small cell lung cancer . ENHERTU has now been approved in three different tumor \ntypes, underscoring its significant potential across several HER2  targetable tumors ,” said Ken Keller, Global \nHead  of Oncology Business, and President and CEO, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc . “We are continuing to evaluate \nthe efficacy and safety of ENHERTU versus standard chemotherapy in our DESTINY clinical trials in lung \ncancer .”\n3 \n “HER2  mutant non -small cell lung cancer is an aggressive form of disease which commonly affects young \npatients who have faced  limited treatment options and a poor prognosis to date ,” said Dave Fredrickson, \nExecutive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, Astra Zeneca. “ Today’s news provides these patients with \nthe opportunity to benefit from a targeted therapy and highlights the importance of testing for predictive \nmarkers, including HER2 in lung cancer, at the time of diagnosis to ensure patients receive the mo st \nappropriate treatment for their specific disease .” \n \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca are committed to ensuring that patients in the U.S. who are prescribed \nENHERTU can access the medication and receive necessary financial support. Provider and patient sup port, \nreimbursement and distribution for ENHERTU in the U.S. will be accessible by visiting \nwww.ENHERTU4U.com  or calling 1 -833-ENHERTU (1 -833-364-3788).  \n  \nPlease visit  www.ENHERTU.com  for full  Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, \nand Medication Guide . \n \nFinancial Considerations  \nFollowing approval in the U.S., an amount of $ 125 million is due from AstraZeneca to Daiichi Sankyo as a \nmilestone payment for a second -line indication for ENHERTU in HER2  mutant NSCLC .  \n \nSales of ENHERTU in the U.S. are recognized by Daiichi Sankyo. For further details on the financial \narrangements, please consult the collaboration agreement from March 2019 . \n \nAbout DESTINY -Lung02  \nDESTINY -Lung02 is a global phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of two doses (5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 \nmg/kg) of ENHERTU in patients with HER2 mutant metastatic NSCLC with disease recurrence or \nprogression during o r after at least one regimen of prior anticancer therapy that must have contained a \nplatinum -based chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study is ORR as assessed by BICR. Secondary \nendpoints include  disease control rate ( DCR ), DoR, progression -free survival ( PFS), investigator -assessed \nORR, overall survival ( OS) and safety. DESTINY -Lung02 enrolled 15 2 patients at multiple sites, including \nAsia, Europe and North America.

The primary endpoint is \nconfi rmed ORR by independent central review ( ICR). Key secondary endpoints include DoR, DCR, PFS, OS \nand safety. DESTINY -Lung01 enrolled 181 patients at multiple sites, including Asia, Europe and North \nAmerica.  \n \nData from the DESTINY -Lung01 phase 2 trial were published in The New England Journal of Medicine . \nPrimary results from previously -treated patients with HER2  mutations (cohort 2) of DESTINY -Lung01 \ndemonstrated an ORR of 54.9% ( n=50; 95% CI : 44.2-65.4) in patients treated with ENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) \nas assessed by ICR. Out of a total of 91 patients , one (1.1%) CR and 49 (53.8%) PRs were observed.  \n \nA confirmed DCR of 92.3% (95% CI: 84.8 -96.9) was seen with a reduction in tum or size observe d in most \npatients. After a median follow -up of 13.1 months, the median DoR for ENHERTU was 9.3 months  (95% \nCI: 5.7 -14.7) . The median PFS was 8.2 months (95% CI: 6.0 -11.9) and the median OS was 17.8 months  \n(95% CI: 13.8 -22.1) . \n \nThe safety profile of the mo st common adverse events with ENHERTU  in DESTINY -Lung01 was consistent \nwith previous clinical trials with no new safety concerns identified. For more information about the trial, visit \nClinica lTrials.gov . \n \nAbout  HER2  Mutant  NSCLC   \nLung cancer is the second most common form of cancer globally, with more than two million  patients \ndiagnosed in 2020.1 In the U.S., lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, with more than \n236,000 patients  expected to be diagnosed in 2022.2 For patients with metastatic NSCLC, prognosis is \nparticularly poor, as only approximately 8% will live beyond five ye ars after diagnosis.3 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors, including lung, breast, gastric and colorectal cancers. Certain HER2 gene alterations (called HER2  \nmutations) have been id entified in patients with non -squamous NSCLC as a distinct molecular target, and \noccur in approximately 2  to 4% of patients with this type of lung cancer .4,5 While HER2  gene mutations can \noccur in a range of patients, they are more commonly found in patients with NSCLC who are younger, \nfemale and have never smoked.6 HER2 gene mutations have been independently associated with cancer cell \ngrowth and poor prognosis, with a n increased incidence of brain metastases.7\n5 \n Although the role of anti -HER2 treatment is well established in breast and gastric cancers, there were no \napproved HER2 directed therapies in NSCLC prior to the accelerated approval of ENHERTU in unresectable \nor metastatic NSCLC.7,8 Next -generation sequencing has been utilized in the identification of HER2  (ERBB2 ) \nmutations.9 \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 \ndirected ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is the lead \nADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most adv anced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific platform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is appro ved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients  with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior  \nanti-HER2 -based regimen, either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, and have \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or wit hin six months of completing therapy , based on the results from \nthe DESTINY -Breast03  trial. ENHERTU also is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior \nanti-HER2 -based regimens based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved i n the U.S. for the treatment of  adult patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic HER2 low (immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+ or IHC 2+/ in-situ hybridization (ISH) -) breast cancer \nwho have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disea se recurrence during or \nwithin six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy, based on the results from  the DESTINY -Breast04  \ntrial. \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have activating HER2 (ERBB2 ) mutation s, as \ndetected by an FDA -approved test, and who have received a prior systemic therapy , based on the results of \nthe DESTINY -Lung02  trial. \n \nENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.\n6 \n ENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo -Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see the accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide . \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2  targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combination with other antica ncer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n \nRegulatory applications for ENHERTU in breast and gastric cancer are currently under review in several \ncountries based on the DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -Breast04, DESTINY -Gastric0 1 \nand DESTINY -Gastric02  trials , respectively.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019  and datopotamab  deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020 , except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the \nmanufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nImportant Safety Information  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based \nregimen either:  \n– In the metastatic setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six \nmonths of completing therapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -) breast cancer who have received a prior \nchemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whos e tumors have activating HER2 \n(ERBB2) mutations, as detected by an FDA -approved test, and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continue d approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.\n7 \n • Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior tras tuzumab -based regimen  \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for ef fective contraception.  \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life -threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any \nnew or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly \ninvestigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Cons ider \nconsultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days \nfrom date of onset, reduce dose one lev el. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or \ngreater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroi d treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients w ith metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, ILD \noccurred in 12% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 1.0% of patients treated \nwith ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 5  months (ran ge: 0.9  to 23). \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first ons et was 2.8  months (range: \n1.2 to 21). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicat ed. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L), interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, the n reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC \n<1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)\n8 \n In patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a \ndecrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Sixteen percent had Grade  3 or 4 decreased \nneutrophil count. Median time  to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22  days (range: 2  to 664). \nFebrile neutropenia was reported in 1.1% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gast ric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty -one percent had \nGrade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n16 days (r ange: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and \nabsolute decre ase from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment \nwithin 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from \nbaseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume \ntreatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is \n>20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF asse ssment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU \nhas not been stud ied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to \ninitiation of treatment.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with  ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \nLVEF decrease was reported in 3.6% of patients, of which 0.4% were Grade  3. \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade  2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraceptio n during treatment and for \n7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose \nof ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditiona l Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by one level.\n9 \n Adverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant NSCLC (5.4  mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg intravenously every 3  weeks in 984 \npatients in Study DS820 1-A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -\nBreast04, and DESTINY -Lung02.

Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a \nbreastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing : Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use \neffective cont raception during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for 4 months after the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male \nreproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 883  patients with breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 \nyears and 3.6% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed \nbetween patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade \n3-4 adverse reactions observed in pat ients aged ≥65 years (60%) as compared to younger patients (48%). \nOf the 101  patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -mutant NSCLC treated with ENHERTU \n5.4 mg/kg, 40% were ≥65 years and 8% were ≥75  years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety \nwere observed between patients ≥65  years of age compared to younger patients. Of the 125  patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU \n6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65  years and 14%  were ≥75  years. No overall differences \nin efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate re nal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate renal impairment more frequently. The \nrecommended dosage of ENHERTU has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment \n(CLcr <30 mL/min).\n12 \n • Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic i mpairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.

    "content": "Press Release  \n \nENHERTU® Approved in the U.S. as the First HER2 Directed \nTherapy for Patients with HER2 Low Metastatic Br east Cancer  \n \n• Based on  DESTINY -Breast04 results  which showed Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s ENHERTU \nreduced risk of disease progression or death by 50% and increased overall survival by more than six \nmonths versus  chemotherapy  \n \nTokyo and Basking Ridge, NJ – ( August 5, 2022)  – Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568 ) and AstraZeneca ’s \n(LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN)  ENHERTU® (fam- trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki) has been approved in  the U.S.  \nfor the treatment of  adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ ISH-) breast \ncancer  who have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence \nduring or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy.  \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) bein g jointly \ndeveloped and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca.  \nThe approval was granted under the FDA’s Real- Time Oncology Review (RTOR) program following the \nrecent  Priority Review  and Breakthrough Therapy Designation of ENHERTU in the U.S.  in this setting . The \nexpanded approval for ENHERTU in the U.S. enables its use across a wide spectrum of HER2 expression , \nincluding patients with HER2 low disease. \n The approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) was based on positive results from the \nDESTINY -Breast04  phase 3 trial  of previously treated patients with HER2 low metastatic breast cancer . In \nthe trial, ENHERTU demonstrated a 49 % reduction in the risk of disease progression or death versus \nphysician’s choice of chemotherapy in patients with HER2 low metastatic breast cancer with hormone \nreceptor ( HR) positive disease (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.51; 95% confidence interval [ CI]: 0.40-0.64 ; \np<0.0001 ). A median progression -free survi val (PFS) of 10.1 months ( 95% CI: 9.5 -11.5) was seen in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU compared to 5.4 months ( 95% CI: 4.4-7.1) with chemotherapy, as assessed by \nblinded independent central review (BICR). Results also showed a 36% reduction in the risk of death with \nENHERTU compared to chemotherapy in patients with HR positive disease (HR= 0.64; 95% CI: 0.4 8-0.86; \np=0.0028) with a median overall survival ( OS) of 23.9 months with ENHERTU (95% CI: 20.8-24.8) versus \n17.5 months with chemotherapy (95% CI: 15.2-22.4).  \n In the overall trial population of patients with HER2 low metastatic breast cancer with HR  positive or HR  \nnegative disease and across levels of HER2  expression ( both IHC 1+ and IHC 2+/ISH- ) a similar 50%\nreduction in the  risk of disease progression or death was observed between ENHERTU and chemotherapy \n(HR=0.50; 95% CI:0.40- 0.63; p<0.0001) , with a median PFS of 9.9 months ( 95% CI: 9.0- 11.3) for \nENHERT U versus 5.1 months ( 95% CI: 4.2- 6.8) in those treated with chemotherapy, as assessed by BICR. A \nmedian OS of 23.4 months ( 95% CI: 20.0- 24.8) was seen in patients treated with ENHERTU versus 16.8 \nmonths ( 95% CI: 14.5- 20.0) in those treated with chemotherapy (HR=0.64; 95% CI: 0.49- 0.84; p=0.001).  \n \n“Approximately half of all patients with breast cancer have tumors that are HER2 low, which have \npreviously been classified as HER2  negative and have not had effective tr eatment options  with HER2 \ntargeted medicines,”  said Shanu Modi, MD, medical oncologist, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  \nand principal investigator for the trial . “Based on the promising results of the DESTINY -Breast04  trial, \nclinicians are starting to differentiate levels of HER2 expression and redefine how metastatic breast cancer is \nclassified with a distinct HER2  low patient population that may be eligible for trastuzumab deruxtecan .” \n \nAdditional results  from the DESTINY -Breast04 trial  showed that in patients with HR positive disease, the \nconfirmed objective response rate (ORR) more than tripled in the ENHERTU arm versus the chemotherapy \narm ( 52.9% [n=175; 95% CI: 47.3- 58.4] versus 16. 6% [n=27; 95% CI: 11.2- 23.2], respectively ). Twelve \n(3.6%) complete responses (CR) and 164 (49.5 %) partial responses (PR) were observed in patients with HR \npositive disease treated with ENHERTU compared to one (0.6%) CR and 26 ( 16%) PRs in those treated with \nchemotherapy. Median duration of response was 10.7 months for ENHERTU  versus 6.8 months for \nchemotherapy.  \n In the overall trial population, c onfirmed ORR more than tripled in the ENHERTU arm (52.3% [ n=195; 95% \nCI: 47.1- 57.4] ) versus those treated  with chemotherapy ( 16.3% [ n=30; 95% CI: 11. 3-22.5] ). Thirteen  (3.5%) \nCRs and 183 (49.1 %) PRs  were observed in patients treated with ENHERTU compared to two (1.1%) CR s \nand 28 (15.2 %) PRs in those treated with chemotherapy. Median duration of response was 10.7 months for \nENHERTU  versus 6.8 months for chemotherapy.  \n \nENHERTU  is approved with Boxed WARNINGS for interstitial lung disease (ILD)/ pneumonitis and \nEmbryo -Fetal toxicity. The safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 371 patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic  HER2  low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ ISH-) breast cancer who received at least one dose of  \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in the DESTINY -Breast04 trial . The most common adverse reactions (frequency \n≥20%), including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea, decreased white blood cell count, decreased \nhemoglobin, decreased neutrophil count, decreased lymphocyte count, fatigue, decreased platelet count, alopecia, vomiting, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased alanine aminotransferase, constipation, \nincreased blood alkaline phosphatase, decreased appetite, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea and hypokalemia . \nOverall, 12% of patients had confirmed ILD or pneumonitis related to treatment as determined by an independent adjudication committee. The majority of ILD events were primarily low grade, with five grade 3 \n(1.3%) and no grade 4 events reported. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4% of patients\nincluding ILD/pneumonitis ( three  patients); sepsis ( two patients); and ischemic colitis, disseminated \nintravascular coagulation, dyspnea, febrile neutropenia, general physical health deterioration, pleural effusion \nand respiratory failure.   “Today’s FDA approval marks a monumental moment in breast cancer treatment as ENHERTU is the firs t-\never HER2 directed medicine to be approved for the treatment of patients with HER2 low metastatic breast \ncancer ,” said Ken Keller, Global Head  of Oncology Business, and President and CEO, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. \n“With the groundbreaking survival benefit seen in the DESTINY -Breast04 trial,  this milestone confirms the \nimportance of targeting lower levels of HER2  expression in  the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and w\ne \nare thrilled that we can now offer ENHERTU to  even more patients .” \n “The rapid approval of ENHERTU in HER2 low metastatic breast cancer by the FDA underscores the urgency to bring this transformational medicine to patients as quickly as possible ,” said Dave Fredrickson, \nExecutive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, AstraZeneca . “Patients with HER2 low tumors , who are \nidentified through existing HER2 testing methods, will now have the opportunity to be treated based upon their HER2 status .” \n Based on the DESTINY- Breast04 data, fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki (ENHERTU) was added to the \nNCCN Clinical Practical Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines\n®) in June 2022 as the Category 1 \npreferred regimen for patients with tumors that are HER2 IHC 1+ or 2+ and ISH negative who have received \nat least one  prior line of chemotherapy for metastatic disease and, if tumor is HR+, are refractory to \nendocrine therapy.1  \n \nAs part of Project Orbis, ENHERTU also is under regulatory review for the same indication by the \nAustralian Therapeutic Goods Administration, Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA), Health Canada and Switzerland’s Swissmedic.  \n Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca are committed to ensuring that patients in the U.S. who are prescribed ENHERTU can access the medication and receive necessary financial support. Provider and patient support, reimbursement and distribution for ENHERTU in the U.S. will be accessible by visiting \nwww.ENHERTU4U.com or calling 1 -833- ENHERTU (1 -833-364-3788).  \n \nPlease visit www.ENHERTU.com  for full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and \nMedication Guide .\nFinancial Considerations  \nFollowing approval in the U.S., an amount of $200 million is due from AstraZeneca to Daiichi Sankyo as a \nmilestone payment for an indication for ENHERTU in patients with HER2 low metastatic breast cancer  who \nwere previously treated with one or two  lines of chemotherapy .  \n \nSales of ENHERTU in the U.S. are recognized by Daiichi Sankyo. For further details on the financial \narrangements, please consult the collaboration agreement from March 2019 . \n About DESTINY- Breast04   \nDESTINY -Breast04  is a global, randomized, open-label, pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and \nsafety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) versus physician’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel or nab -paclitaxel) in patients with HR positive or HR negative , HER2 low \nunresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with one or two prior lines of chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either ENHERTU or chemotherapy.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY- Breast04 is PFS  in patients with HR positive disease based on BICR . \nKey secondary endpoints include PFS based on BICR in all randomized patients (HR positive and HR \nnegative disease), OS in patients with HR positive disease and OS in all randomized patients (HR positive and HR negative disease). Other secondary endpoints include PFS based on investigator assessment, objective response rate based on BICR and on investigator assessment, duration of response based on BICR and safety. DESTINY-Breast04 enrolled 557 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America.  \nFor more information about the trial, visit \nClinicalTrials.gov.  \n \nAbout Breast Cancer and HER2 Expression  \nBreast cancer is  the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide \nand in the U.S.2,3 More than two million patients with  breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020 with nearly \n685,000 deaths globally.2  In the U.S., more than 290,000 patients are expected to be diagnosed in 2022, with \nmore than 43,000 deaths.4 Approximately one in five patients  with  breast cancer are considered HER2 \npositive.5 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers, and is one of many biomarkers expressed in \nbreast cancer tumors.6 \n \nHER2 expression is currently determined by an IHC test which estimates the amount of HER2 protein on a \ncancer cell, and/or an ISH test, which counts the copies of the HER2 gene in cancer cells.6,7 HER2 tests \nprovide IHC and ISH scores across the full HER2 spectrum and are routinely used to determine appropriate \ntreatment options for patients with metastatic breast cancer . HER2  positive cancers are currently defined as\nHER2 expression measured as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+, and HER2 negative cancers are defined as HER2 \nexpression measured as IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-.6 However, approximately half of all breast cancers \nare HER2  low, defined as a HER2  score of IHC1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -.8,9,10 HER2  low occurs in both HR \npositive and HR negative disease.11 \n \nPreviously, patients with HR positive metastatic breast cancer and  HER2  low disease had limited effective \ntreatment options following progression on endocrine (hormone) therapy. 9,12 Additionally, few targeted \noptions were available for those with HR negative disease.13 Now with  the approval of ENHERTU, patients \nwith HER2  low tumors may be eligible for HER2  directed therapy.  \n \nAbout ENHERTU ENHERTU\n® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 \ndirected ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced pr ogram in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific platform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide- based cleavable linker.  \n ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients  with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior  \nanti-HER2 -based regimen , either in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant se tting, and have \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy, based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial. ENHERTU also is approved in several countr ies for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior \nanti-HER2 -based regimens based on the results from the D ESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S.  for the treatment of  adult patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic HER2 low (immuno histochemistry ( IHC) 1+ or  IHC 2+/in -situ hybridization ( ISH)-) breast cancer \nwho have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy, based on the results of the DESTINY -Breast04  \ntrial.  ENHERTU (6.4  mg/kg) is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen base d on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.  \n ENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please se e the accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide .\nAbout  the ENHERTU Clinical Development  Program \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy a nd safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  \nRegulatory applications for ENHERTU in breast, gastric and non- small cell lung cancers  are currently under \nreview in several countries based on the DESTINY -Breast01, DESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -Breast04, \nDESTINY -Gastric01, DESTINY- Gastric02 and DESTINY -Lung01 trials, respectively.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration \nDaiich i Sankyo Company, Limited (referred to as Daiichi Sankyo) and AstraZeneca entered into a \nglobal collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab \nderuxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights \nfor each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan. \nImportant Safety Information  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based \nregimen either:  \n– In the metastati c setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six \nmonths of completing therapy  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH- ) breast cancer who have received a prior \nchemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of \ncompleting adjuvant chemotherapy  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen  \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY  \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \nContraindications  \nNone. \n \nWarnings and Precautions \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or\nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor pa tients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue f or at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.   \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant Solid Tumors (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and other solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, ILD \noccurred in 12% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 1.0% of patients treated \nwith ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 5  months (range: 0.9 to 23). \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanc ed or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8  months (range: \n1.2 to  21.0). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 10\n9/L), interrupt ENHERTU unt il \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC \n<1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3º C or a sustained temperature of ≥38º C for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant Solid Tumors (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and other solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a \ndecrease in neutrophil count was reported in 65% of patients. Sixteen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased \nneutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 days (range: 2  to 664). \nFebrile neutropenia  was reported in 1.1% of patients. \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty- one percent had \nGrade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was \n16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunc tion \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENH ERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40- 45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recov ered to within 10% from \nbaseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is \n>20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF  assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU\nhas not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to \ninitiation of treatment.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant Solid Tumors (5.4 mg/kg) \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer and other solid tumors treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, LVEF decrease was reported in 3.6% of patients, of which 0.4% were Grade 3.  \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer (6.4 mg/kg)  \nIn patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcin oma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraceptio n during treatment and for \nat least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt E NHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less, then reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer and HER2 -Mutant Solid Tumors (5.4  mg/kg)  \nThe pooled safety population reflects exposure to ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks in 984 \npatients in Study DS8201-A-J101 (NCT02564900), DESTINY- Breast01, DESTINY -Breast03, DESTINY -\nBreast04, and NCT04644237. Among these patients 65% were expos ed for >6 months and 39% were \nexposed for >1 year. In this pooled safety population, the most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including \nlaboratory abnormalities, were nausea (76%), decreased white blood cell count (71%), decreased hemoglobin \n(66%), decreased neutrophil count (65%), decreased lymphocyte count (55%), fatigue (54%), decreased \nplatelet count (47%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (48%), vomiting (44%), increased alanine \naminotransferase (42%), alopecia (39%), increased blood alkaline phos phatase (39%), constipation (34%), \nmusculoskeletal pain (32%), decreased appetite (32%), hypokalemia (28%), diarrhea (28%), and respiratory \ninfection (24%).  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nDESTINY-Breast03 \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 257 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast \ncancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg intravenously every three weeks in DESTINY -Breast03.

Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. \nMales : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception \nduring treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU \nmay impair male reproductive function and fertility. \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENH ERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 883 patients with breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 \nyears and 3.6% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed \nbetween patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-\n4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (60%) as compared to younger patients (48%). Of \nthe 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1- 800-FDA-1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and \nMedication Guide . \n About  Daiichi  Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our \nworld -class science and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life \naround the world.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular \ndisease, Daiichi  Sankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as \nwell as other diseases with  high unmet  medical needs.

The application has been granted Priority Review.  \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly \ndeveloped and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca.  \n \nThe FDA  grants Priority Review to applications for medicines that , if approved, would offer sign ificant \nimprovements over available options by demonstrating safety or efficacy improvements, preventing serious conditions or enhancing patient compliance. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act date (PDUFA) , the FDA \naction date for their regulatory decision , is during the fourth  quarter of the 2022 calendar year . The Priority \nReview follows receipt of  Breakthrough Therapy  Designation, granted by the FDA in April  2022 for \nENHERTU in metastatic HER2 low breast cancer . \n \nThe sBLA is being reviewed under  the Real -Time Oncology Review (RTOR) program and Project Orbis, \ntwo initiatives of the FDA which are designed to bring safe and effective cancer treatments to patients as \nearly as possible. RTOR allows  the FDA to review  components of an application before submission of the \ncomplete  application. Project Orbis provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology \nmedicines among participating international partners . \n \n“The results seen in the DESTINY -Breast04  trial represent  a significant advance and reinforce the potential \nfor ENHERTU to become a new standard of care for patients with previously treated HER2 low metastatic \nbreast cancer ,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “ The prioritization of this\n2 \n application by the FDA and inclusion in both the Real -Time Oncology Review and Project Orbis initiatives \nsupport  the importance of these data, and we look forward to working with the FDA to potentially bring \nENHERTU to patients with HER2 low metastatic brea st cancer as quickly as possible .”  \n \n“The data from DESTINY -Breast04 represent the first time a HER2 targeted therapy has shown a survival \nbenefit in patients with HER2  low metastatic breast cancer ,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, \nExecutive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “ For more than two decades , only patients with \nHER2 positive breast cancer  have been able to benefit from HER2 targeted therapies. If approved, \nENHERTU will redefine how we classify and treat metastatic breast cancer, enabling patients whose tumors \nhave lower levels of HER2 expression the opportunity to benefit from a HER2 directed therapy.”   \n \nThe sBLA is based on data from the DESTINY -Breast04  phase 3 trial recently presented  at the presidential \nplenary session of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (#ASCO22) Annual Meeting and \nsimultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine . In DESTINY -Breast04,  ENHERTU \ndemonstrated superior and clinically meaningful efficacy in progression -free survival (PFS) and overall \nsurviv al (OS) i n previously treated  patients with HER2 low  unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer  with \nhormone receptor ( HR) positive or HR negative disease versus standard of care physician’s choice of \nchemotherapy. The safety profile of ENHERTU  was consistent with previous clinical trials with no new \nsafety concerns identified. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis rates were consistent with those \nobserved in other  late-line HER2 positive breast cancer trials of ENHERTU , as determined by an \nindependent adjudication committee.  \n About DESTINY- Breast04   \nDESTINY -Breast04 is a global, randomized, open- label, pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy  and \nsafety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) versus physician’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel or nab -paclitaxel) in patients with HR positive or HR negative , HER2 low \nunresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously t reated with one or two prior lines of chemotherapy. \nPatients were randomized 2:1 to receive either ENHERTU or chemotherapy.   \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY -Breast04 is PFS in patients with HR positive disease based on blinded \nindependent central review (BICR) . Key secondary endpoints include PFS based on BICR in all randomized \npatients (HR positive and HR negative disease), OS in patients with HR positive disease and OS in all \nrandomized patients (HR positive and HR negative disease). Other secondary endpoints include PFS based on investigator assessment, objective response rate based on BICR and on investigator assessment, dura tion \nof response based on BICR and safety. DESTINY -Breast04 enrolled 557 patients at multiple sites in Asia, \nEurope and North America.  For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov .\n3 \n  \nAbout Breast Cancer and HER2 Expression  \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.1 More than two million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020 with nearly 685,000 \ndeaths gl obally.1 In the U.S., more than 290,000 new cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2022, with more \nthan 43,000 deaths.2 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive .3 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth- promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers, and is one of many biomarkers expressed in \nbreast cancer tumors.4 \n \nHER2 expression is currently defined as either positive or  negative, and is determined by an IHC test which \nestimates the amount of HER2 protein on a cancer cell, and/or an ISH test, which counts the copies of the \nHER2 gene in cancer cells.4,5 HER2 positive cancers are defined as IHC 3+, IHC 2+/ISH+.4 HER2 negative \ncancers are currently defined as IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -.4 Approximately half of all patients with \nbreast cancer have tumors with low HER2 expression , with a  HER2 IHC score of 1+, or a HER2 IHC score \nof 2+ in combination with a negative ISH test , an expression level  not currently eligible for HER2 targeted \ntherapy.3,6,7,8 Low HER2 expression occurs in both HR positive and HR negative disease.9  \n \nHER2 testing is routinely used to determine appropriate treatment options for patients with metastatic breast \ncancer. Targeting the lower range of expression in the HER2 spectrum may offer another approach to delay \ndisease progression and extend survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer.10 Currently, patients with \nlow HER2 expression with HR positive tumors have limited treatment options following progression on \nendocrine (hormone) therapy.11 Few targeted options are available for those who are HR negative.12 \n About ENHERTU ENHERTU\n® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 \ndirected ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific platform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a  topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients  with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen \neither in the metastatic setting, or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease \nrecurrence during or within six months of completing therapy, based on results from the DESTINY -Breast03\n4 \n trial. ENHERTU also  is approved in s everal countries for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -based regimens \nbased on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a p rior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxic ity. For more information, please see the accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide . \n \nAbout  the ENHERTU  Clinical Development  Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  \n \nRegulatory applications for ENHERTU are currently  under review in  China,  Japan  and several other \ncountries for the treatment of adult patients with  HER2 positive  unresectable or metastatic breast cancer who \nhave received a prior anti -HER2-based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY- Breast03  trial. \n \nENHERTU is under review in Europe  and Japan  for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -negative) breast cancer who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing \nadjuvant chemotherapy, based on the results from the  DESTINY -Breast04  trial. Patients with HR positive \nbreast cancer must additionally have received or be ineligible for endocrine therapy. \n \nENHERTU also is currently under revi ew in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or  \nmetastatic non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) whose tumors have a HER2 (ERBB2)  mutation and who have \nreceived a prior systemic therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Lung01  trial, and in Europe  for \nthe treatment of adult  patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or GEJ \nadenocarcinoma who have  received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen based on the DESTINY -Gastric01  and \nDESTINY -Gastric02  trials .\n5 \n About  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (referred to as Daiichi Sankyo) and AstraZeneca entered into a \nglobal collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights \nfor each ADC. Daiichi  Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and \ndatopotamab deruxtecan.  \n Important Safety Information for ENHERTU \n \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of  \nadult patients with:  \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based \nregimen either:  \n– In the metastatic setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six \nmonths of completing therapy  \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen  \n \n WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY  \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \nContraindications\n \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Eval uate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. I f resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n Metastati c Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 491 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 13% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis\n6 \n occurred in 1.4% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (range: 1.1 \nto 20.8).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma t reated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to \nfirst onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2  to 21.0).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x \n109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 491 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who \nreceived ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 68% of patients. Eighteen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil \ncount was 22 days (range: 6 to 664). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.2% of patients.  \n Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% \nof patients. Fifty- one percent had G rade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of \npatients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at incr eased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as  \nclinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40- 45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatmen t with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment \nwithin 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40- 45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from \nbaseline, permanently dis continue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume \ntreatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is \n>20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or ab solute \ndecrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU \nhas not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to \ninitiation of treatment.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn the 491 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU 5.4 \nmg/kg, 13 cases (2.6%) of asymptomatic LVEF decre ase were reported.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were \nreported; however, on echocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.\n7 \n  \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \nat least 7 months following the last dose of ENHER TU. Advise male patients with female partners of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 \nmonths after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 throm bocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer   \nThe pooled safety population for patients with metastatic breast cancer reflects exposure to ENHERTU at 5.4 \nmg/kg given as an intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks (21- day cycle) in 491 patients in DESTINY -\nBreast03, DE STINY -Breast01, and Study DS8201- A-J101. The median duration of treatment was 13 months \n(range: 0.7 to 37). In this pooled safety population, the most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including \nlaboratory abnormalities, were nausea (78%), decreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased hemoglobin \n(68%), decreased neutrophil count  (68%), increased aspartate aminotransferase  (58%), fatigue  (57%), \ndecreased lymphocyte count  (56%), vomiting  (50%), decreased platelet count  (49%), increased alanine \naminotransfe rase (48%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase  (45%), alopecia  (41%), constipation (35%), \nhypokalemia  (33%), decreased appetite  (32%), diarrhea  (31%), musculoskeletal pain  (28%), increased \ntransaminases (27%), respiratory infection  (24%), headache  (21%),  and abdominal pain (21%).  \n \nDESTINY- Breast03  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 257 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast \ncancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Breast03. ENHERTU was \nadministered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks . The median duration of treatment was 14 \nmonths (range: 0.7 to 30).   \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 19% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were vomiting, interstitial lung disease, pneu monia, pyrexia, and \nurinary tract infection. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients including COVID -19 \nand sudden death (one patient each).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 14% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis account ed for 8%. \nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, pneumonia, nausea, fatigue, and ILD/pneumonitis. Dose reductions occurred in 21% of \npatients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction \nwere nausea, neutropenia, and fatigue.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (76%), \ndecreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (70%), increased aspartate \naminotransferase (67%), decreased hemoglobin (64%), decreased lymphocyte count (55%), increased alanine \naminotra nsferase (53%), decreased platelet count (52%), fatigue (49%), vomiting (49%), increased blood \nalkaline phosphatase (49%), alopecia (37%), hypokalemia (35%), constipation (34%), musculoskeletal pain \n(31%), diarrhea (29%), decreased appetite (29%), respirat ory infection (22%), headache (22%), abdominal pain \n(21%), increased blood bilirubin (20%), and stomatitis (20%).\n8 \n Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2- positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in DESTINYGastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly \nor paclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5  to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6 .4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, pneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in \n2.4% of patients:  disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred \nin one patient each (0.8%).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions oc curred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, leukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, and febrile neutro penia.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased hemoglobin \n(75%), decreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (72%), decreased lymphocyte count \n(70%), decreased platelet count (68% ), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), increased aspartate \naminotransferase (58%), fatigue (55%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (54%), increased alanine aminotransferase (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24% ), increased \nblood bilirubin (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \n \nUse in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients \nof the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant \nwomen, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effe cts on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions \nin a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 \nmonths after the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy t esting : Verify pregnancy status of \nfemales of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of \nreproductive potential to use effective contr aception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least \n7 months following the last dose. Males : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 491 patients with HER2 -positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU \n5.4 mg/kg, 22% were ≥65 years and 4% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There \nwas a highe r incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (60%) as \ncompared to younger patients (49%). Of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -\npositive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg i n DESTINY- Gastric01, \n56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were \nobserved between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis  has been observed in \npatients with moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.\n9 \n • Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased \nexposure, closely monitor for increased  toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-\n7763 or  FDA at 1-800-FDA -1088 or fda.gov/medwatch. \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and \nMedication Guide . \n \nAbout  Daiichi  Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our \nworld -class science and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life \naround the  world.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular \ndisease, Daiichi  Sankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as \nwell as other diseases with  high unmet  medical needs.

In the DESTINY -Breast03 trial, ENHERTU  \nreduced the risk of disease progression or death by 72% versus  trastuzumab emtansine ( T-DM1 ) (hazard \nratio [HR] = 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.22- 0.37; p<0.000 001) in patients with HER2 positive \nunresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab  and a taxane . The median \nprogression- free survival (PFS) for patients treated with ENHERTU  was not reached (95% CI: 18.5- NE) \ncompared to 6.8 months for T -DM1 (95% CI: 5.6- 8.2), as assessed by blinded independent central review \n(BICR).  \n \nIn Europe, more tha n 530,000 patients are diagnosed with breast cancer each year .1 Approximately one in \nfive patients with  breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.2 Despite initial treatment with trastuzumab , \npertuzumab  and a taxane, patients with HER2  positive metastatic breast cancer will often experience disease \nprogression.3,4\n2 \n “This approval is an important milestone for patients and clinicians in Europe, since previously treated \npatients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer  typically experience disease progression in less than a \nyear with historical standard of care treatment ,” said Javier Cortés, MD, PhD, Head, International Breast \nCancer Center (IBCC), Barcelona, Spain. “In the DESTINY -Breast03 trial, the time to progressi on was \nextended well beyond a year for patients receiving ENHERTU, illustrating the potential for this medicine to \nset a new benchmark in the treatment of HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer .”  \n \nAdditional results from the DESTINY -Breast03 phase 3 trial  showed that i n the secondary endpoint of \noverall survival  (OS) , there was a strong trend towards improved OS with ENHERTU  (HR=0.55; 95% CI: \n0.36- 0.86), however this analysis is not yet mature and further follow -up is ongoing. Nearly all patients \ntreated with ENHERTU  were alive at nine months  (96.1% ; 95% CI: 92.8- 97.9) compared to 91.3% of \npatients treated with T -DM1  (95% CI: 87.1- 94.2). Confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was more than \ndoubled in the ENHERTU  arm versus the T -DM1 arm (79.7%  [n=208; 95% CI: 74.3- 84.4] versus  34.2%  \n[n=90; 95% CI: 28.5- 40.3] ).  \n The safety  of ENHERTU has been evaluated in a pooled analysis of 573  patients across multiple tumor types  \nwho had received at least one dose of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) in clinical studies. The median duration of \ntreatment with  ENHERTU was 11.3 months (range 0.7-37.9 mon ths). The most common adverse reactions \nwere nausea (77.0%), fatigue (57.2%), vomiting (46.8%), alopecia (38.0%), neutropenia (34.6%), constipation (33.9%), decreased appetite (33.7%), anemia (32.3%), diarrhea (30.7%), musculoskeletal pain (27.4%), transam inases increased (24.4%), leukopenia (24.1%), thrombocytopenia (23.0%), and upper \nrespiratory tract infection (22.7%) .  \n \nCases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis were reported in 12.0 % of patients. Most ILD cases \nwere g rade 1 (2.6%) and grad e 2 (7.3%). Grade 3 cases occurred in 0.7%  of patients, no grade 4 cases \noccurred  and g rade 5 cases occurred i n 1.4 % of patients. Patients should be advised to immediately report \ncough, dyspnea  (shortness of breath) , fever and/or any new worsening respiratory symptoms. Patients should \nbe monitored for signs and symptoms of ILD or pneumonitis and those with suspected ILD or pneumonitis \nshould be evaluated by radiographic imaging, preferably a computed tomography (CT) scan. Patients with a \nhistory of ILD or pneumonitis may be at increased risk.  \n \n“We believe there is a significant need  to transform outcomes f or patients with HER2 positive metastatic \nbreast cancer in Europe ,” said Ken Keller, Global Head  of Oncology Business, and President and CEO, \nDaiichi Sankyo, Inc . “In DESTINY -Breast03 , treatment with ENHERTU demonstrated superior progression -\nfree survival and a doubling of the response rate compared to another HER2 directed ADC . With this \napproval  we are now able to offer patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer  another option earlier \nin their treatment .”\n3 \n  \n“With this approval, patients across Europe with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer will have the \nopportunity to be treated with ENHERTU even earlier in the treatment of their disease, improving their \nchance for better outcomes  beyond what we can already offer patients treated in later line settings,” said \nDave Fredrickson, Executive Vice Pres ident, Oncology Business Unit, AstraZeneca. “ Today’s news is a \nfurther step in achieving our vision to continuously bring the transformative potential of ENHERTU to \npatients as early as possible in their treatment to improve cancer outcomes. ”  \n \nBased on the results of DESTINY -Breast03, the European Society for Medical Oncology Clinical Practice \nGuidelines were updated in October 2021 to recommend ENHERTU for use as the preferred second- line \ntherapy for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer  following progression with a taxane and \ntrastuzumab .5  \n As part of this approval, the EC has also extended the market protection period for ENHERTU in this setting \nby one extra year based on the significant clinical benefit compared to existing a pproved therapies. \n \nFinancial Considerations  \nFollowing approval in the EU, an amount of $75 million is due from AstraZeneca to Daiichi Sankyo as a second -line milestone payment in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer. For further details on the financial  \narrangements, please consult the collaboration agreement from March 2019 . \n About DESTINY- Breast03  \nDESTINY -Breast03  is a global, head -to-head, randomized, open- label , pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating  the \nefficacy  and safety  of ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg ) versus T -DM1 in patients with HER2 positive unresectable \nand/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and  a taxane. The primary efficacy \nendpoint of DESTINY -Breast03 is  PFS based on blinded independent central review. Overall survival (OS) \nwas a key secondary efficacy  outcome measure.  Secondary endpoints include d ORR , duration of response  \nand PFS based on investigator assessment. DESTINY -Breast03 enrolled 524  patients at multiple sites in \nAsia, Europe , North America, Oceania and South America . Results from DESTINY -Breast03 have been \npublished in The  New England Journal of Medicine\n. For more information about the trial, visit \nClinicalTrials.gov .\n4 \n About HER2  Positive Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide .6 More than two million patients were diagnosed with  breast cancer in 2020, with nearly 685,000 \ndeaths globally .6 In Europe, more than  530,000 patients are diagnosed with breast cancer each year .1 \nApproximately one in five patients with breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.2 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth- promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers.7 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a \nresult of HER2  gene amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in \nbreast cancer.8 \n \nDespite initial treatment with trastuzumab , pertuzumab  and a taxane, patients with HER2 positive metastatic \nbreast cancer will often experience disease progression .3,4 \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU (t rastuzumab deruxtecan , fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only ) is a HER2  directed \nADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU  is the lead ADC in \nthe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most adva nced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific \nplatform. ENHERTU  consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor \npayload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approv ed in more than 30 countries  for the treatment of adult patients  with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a (or one or more) prior  \nanti-HER2 -based regimen either in the metastatic setting, or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have \ndeveloped disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy, based on the results from \nthe DESTINY -Breast03  trial. ENHERTU  also is app roved in several  countries for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior \nanti-HER2 -based regimens based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior t rastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.  \n About the ENHERTU  Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU  \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combination with other anticancer tre atments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.\n5 \n  \nRegulatory applications for ENHERTU  are currently under review in  China , Japan  and several other \ncountries for the treatment of adult patients with  HER2 positive  unresectable or metastatic breast cancer who \nhave received a prior anti -HER2-based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY- Breast03  trial. \n \nENHERTU is under review in Europe  and Japan  for the treatment of adult patients with unresec table or \nmetastatic HER2 low ( immunohistochemistry ( IHC) 1+ or IHC 2+/ in-situ hybridization ( ISH)-negative) \nbreast cancer who have received a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease \nrecurrence during or within six months of co mpleting adjuvant chemotherapy, based  on the results from the \nDESTINY -Breast04  trial. Patients with  hormone receptor  (HR) positive breast cancer must additionally have \nreceived or be ineligible for endocrine therapy.  \n \nENHERTU also is currently under review in the U.S.  for the trea tment of adult patients with unresectable or  \nmetastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a HER2 (ERBB2)  mutation and who have received a prior systemic  \ntherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Lung01 and DESTINY -Lung02 trial s, and in Europe  for the \ntreatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma \nwho have  received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen based on the DESTINY -Gastric01  and  \nDESTINY -Gastric02  trials . \n \nENHERTU  recently was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the U.S. for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -negative) breast cancer who have \nreceived a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results of the DESTINY- Breast04  trial. \nPatients with HR positive breast cancer should additionally have received or be ineligible for endocrine therapy.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (referred to as Daiic hi Sankyo) and AstraZeneca entered into a global \ncollaboration to jointly develop and commercialize trastuzumab deruxtecan  in March 2019 and datopotamab \nderux tecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for \neach ADC.

    "content": "Press Release  \n \nTrastuzumab Deruxtecan Supplemental New Drug Application \nSubmitted in Japan for Patients with HER2 Low Metastatic Breast \nCancer  \n \n• Submission based on DESTINY -Breast04 results that showed trastuzumab deruxtecan demonstrated \nsuperior progression- free survival and overall survival versus chemotherapy  \n \nTokyo – ( June 27, 2022)  – Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) today announced that it has submitted a \nsupplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to Japan’s Ministry of Health, L abour and Welfare (MHLW) \nfor trastuzumab deruxtecan for the treatment of adult patients in Japan with HER2 low unresectable or \nrecurrent breast cancer  after prior chemotherapy.  \n \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide, with  nearly 685,000 deaths globally.1 In Japan, breast cancer is the most common cancer in \nwomen, with approximately 92,000 cases of breast cancer diagnosed in 2020.2 Approximately half of all \npatients with breast cancer have tumors with a HER2 immunohistochemistry ( IHC) score of 1+, or a HER2 \nIHC score of 2+ in combination with a negative in -situ hybridization ( ISH) test, an expression level not \ncurrently eligible for HER2 targeted therapy.3,4,5,6  \n \n“The positive DESTINY -Breast04 results represent the first time ever that a HER2 directed therapy has \ndemonstrated a survival benefit in patients with HER2 low metastatic breast cancer, offering the potential to \nredefine how we classify and treat approximately half of all metastatic breast cancers,” said Wataru \nTakasaki, PhD, Executive Officer, Head of R&D Division in Japan, Daiichi Sankyo. “ This submission to the \nJapan MHLW takes us one step closer to bringing trastuzumab deruxtecan to patients with metastatic breast \ncancer who are currently not eligible for a HER2 targeted therap y.” \n \nThe sNDA is based on data from the DESTINY -Breast04  phase 3 trial recently presented  at the plenary \nsession of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (#ASCO22) annual meeting and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine .  \n In DESTINY -Breast04,  trastuzumab deruxtecan demonstrated superior and clinically meaningful efficacy in \nprogression- free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in previously treated  patients with HER2 low  \nunresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer  with hormone receptor ( HR) positive or HR negative disease\n2 \n versus standard of care physician’s choice of che motherapy. The safety profile of trastuzumab deruxtecan  \nwas consistent with previous clinical trials with no new safety concerns identified. Interstitial lung disease \n(ILD) or pneumonitis rates were consistent with that observed in late- line HER2 positive breast cancer trials \nof trastuzumab deruxtecan with a lower rate of grade 5 ILD observed, as determined by an independent \nadjudication committee.  \n About D ESTINY- Breast04  \n \nDESTINY -Breast04 is a global, randomized, open-label, pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and \nsafety of trastuzumab deruxtecan (5.4 mg/kg) versus physician’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel or nab -paclitaxel) in patients with HR positive or HR negative, unresectable \nand/or metastatic breast cancer with low HER2 expression previously treated with one or two prior lines of chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either trastuzumab deruxtecan or chemotherapy.   \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY- Breast04 is PFS in patients with HR positive disease based on blinded \nindependent central review (BICR). Key secondary endpoints include PFS based on BICR in all randomized patients (HR positive and HR negative disease), OS in patients with HR positive disease and OS in all randomized patients (HR positive and HR negative disease). Other secondary endpoints include PFS based on investigator assessment, objective response rate based on BICR and on investigator assessment, duration of response based on BICR and safety. DESTINY- Breast04 enrolled 557  patients at multiple sites in Asia, \nEurope and North America. For more information about the trial, visit \nClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Breast Cancer and HER2 Expression \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer- related deaths \nworldwide.1 More than two million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020, with  nearly 685,000 \ndeaths globally.1 In Japan, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with approximately 92,000 \ncases of breast cancer diagnosed in 2020 .2  \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers, and is one of many bioma rkers expressed in \nbreast cancer tumors.7 \n \nHER2 expression is currently defined as either positive or negative, and is determined by an IHC test which \nestimates the amount of HER2 protein on a cancer cell, and/or an ISH test, which counts the copies of the \nHER2  gene in cancer cells.7,8 HER2 positive cancers are defined as IHC 3+, IHC 2+/ISH+.7 HER2 negative \ncancers are currently defined as IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-.7 Approximately half of all patients with \nbreast cancer have tumors with a HER2 IHC score of 1+, or a HER2 IHC score of 2+ in combination with a\n3 \n negative ISH test, an expression level not currently eligible for HER2 targeted therapy.3,4,5,6 Low HER2 \nexpression occurs in both HR positive and HR negative disease.9  \n \nHER2 testing is routinely used to determine appropriate treatment options for patients with metastatic breast \ncancer. Targeting the lower range of expression in the HER2 spectrum may offer another approach to delay \ndisease progression and extend survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer.10 Currently, patients with \nlow HER2 expression with HR positive tumors have limited treatment options following progression on \nendocrine (hormone) therapy.11 Few targeted options are available for those who are HR negative.12 \n About Trastuzumab Deruxtecan  \nTrastuzumab deruxtecan (fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed antibody \ndrug conjugate ( ADC ). Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, trastuzumab \nderuxtecan is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. Trastuzumab deruxtecan consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody \nattached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide-based \ncleavable linker.  \n Trastuzumab deruxtecan (5.4  mg/kg) is approved in Canada, Israel and the U.S. for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimen either in the metastatic setting, or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy, based on results from the DESTINY -\nBrea st03 trial. Trastuzumab deruxtecan  also is approved in approximately 40 countries for the treatment of \nadult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more \nprior anti -HER2 -based regimens based on the resu lts from the  DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n \nTrastuzumab deruxtecan (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  \ntrial.  \n About the Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab \nderuxtecan  monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and \ncolorectal cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.\n4 \n Regulatory applications for trastuzumab deruxtecan  are currently under review in China, Europe , Japan  and \nseveral other countries for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive unresectable or metastatic \nbreast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -\nBreast03  trial.  \n \nTrastuzumab deruxtecan also is currently under review  in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -negative) breast cancer who have received a \nprior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months \nof completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results of the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  Patients with HR \npositive breast cancer should additionally have received or be ineligible for endocrine therapy.  \nTrastuzumab deruxtecan also is currently under review in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a HER2 ( ERBB2 ) mutation and who have received a \nprior systemic therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Lung01 trial, and in Europe  for the treatment \nof adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior anti- HER 2 based regimen based on the DESTINY -Gastric01  and DESTINY -Gastric02  \ntrials.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Colla boration  \nDaiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (referred to as Daiichi Sankyo) and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize trastuzumab deruxtecan in March 2019 and datopotamab \nderuxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for \neach ADC.

    "content": "Press Release  \nTrastuzumab Deruxtecan Recommended for Approval in the EU by \nCHMP for  Patients with HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nTreated with a  Prior Anti -HER2 -Based Regimen  \n \n• Recommendation b ased on DESTINY -Breast03 trial  results  showing  Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s \ntrastuzumab deruxtecan reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 72% vs. trastuzumab \nemtansine (T -DM1)  \n \nTokyo  and Munich  – (June 27, 2022) – Daiichi Sankyo  (TSE: 4568)  and AstraZeneca’s \n(LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) trastuzumab deruxtecan has been recommended  for approval in the European \nUnion (EU)  as a monotherapy for the  treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 \npositive breast cancer who have received one or more prior anti -HER2 -based regimens.   \n \nTrastuzumab deruxtecan is a specifically engineered HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being \njointly developed and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca.  \n \nThe Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) \nbased its positive opinion on results from the DESTINY -Breast03  phase 3 trial , which were  publi shed in The \nNew England Journal of Medicine . In the DESTINY -Breast03 trial, trastuzumab deruxtecan reduced the risk \nof disease progression or death by 72% versus trastuzumab emtansine (T -DM1) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28; \n95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.22 -0.37; p<0.0001) in patients with HER2 positive unresectable and/or \nmetastatic breast cancer previousl y treated with trastuzumab and a taxane . The median progression -free \nsurvival (PFS) for patients treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan was not reached (95% CI: 18.5 -NE) \ncompared to 6.8 months for T -DM1 (95% CI: 5.6 -8.2) as assessed by blinded independent cen tral review \n(BICR).  \n \nThe recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission, which has the authority to grant \nmarketing authorizations for medicines in the EU.  \n \nIn Europe, more than 530,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually.1 Appr oximately one in five \ncases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.2 Despite initial treatment with trastuzumab , pertuzumab  \nand a taxane, patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer will often experience disease \nprogression.3,4 More treatment options are needed to further delay progression and extend survival .3,5,6\n2 \n “Today’s CHMP opinion provide s further validation of the significance of the  DESTINY -Breast03 trial \nresults, which  for the first time  showed  superiority of trastuzumab deruxtecan in prolon ging progression -free \nsurvival  in patients previously tr eated for HER2 positive metasta tic breast cancer as compared to another \nHER2 dire cted ADC ,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, \nOncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “ This positive  CHMP opinion is an important step \nforward in bringing  this potentially  practice -changing medicine to patients in Europe  to use earlier  in the \ntreatment of HER2 positive  metastatic  breast cancer  and builds on the recent approval of trastuzumab \nderuxtecan  in the U .S.”  \n \n“This recommendation reflects the transformative progression -free survival benefit seen in the  \nDESTINY -Breast03 trial  compared to T -DM1 , supporting trastuzumab deruxtecan as a potential new \nstandard of care  and setting a new benchmark in the treatment of HER2 positive metastatic breast ca ncer,” \nsaid Susan Galbraith , MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D , AstraZeneca . “If approved \nby the European Commission, patients in Europe may be able to benefit from this important medicine earlier \nin the treatment of their disease, impro ving their chance for better outcomes .”  \n \nAdditional results from the DESTINY -Breast03 phase 3 trial showed that i n the secondary endpoint analysis \nof PFS assessed by investigators, patients treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan experienced an improvement \nin PFS of 25.1 months (95% CI: 22.1 -NE) compared to 7.2 months (95% CI: 6.8 -8.3) for T -DM1 (HR=0.26; \n95% CI: 0.20 -0.35). There was a strong trend towards improved overall survival (OS) with trastuzumab \nderuxtecan (HR=0.56; 95% CI: 0.36 -0.86; p=0.007172), however this analysis is not yet mature and is not \nstatistically significant. Nearly all patients treated with trastu zumab deruxtecan were alive at one year \n(94.1%; 95% CI: 90.3 -96.4) compared to 85.9% of patients treated with T -DM1 (95% CI: 80.9 -89.7). \nConfirmed objective response rate (ORR) was more than doubled in the trastuzumab deruxtecan arm versus \nthe T -DM1 arm (7 9.7% [n=208; 95% CI: 74.3 -84.4] versus 34.2% [n=90; 95% CI: 28.5 -40.3]).  \n \nThe safety profile of the most common adverse events with trastuzumab deruxtecan  in DESTINY -Breast03 \nwas consistent with previous clinical trials with no new safety concerns identified. The most common  \ngrade 3 or higher drug -related treatment emergent adverse events in the trastuzumab deruxtecan  arm were \nneutropenia (19.1%), thromboc ytopenia (7.0%), leukopenia (6.6%), nausea (6.6%), anemia (5.8%), fatigue \n(5.1%), vomiting (1.6%), increase d alanine aminotransferase  (1.6%), decreased appetite (1.2%), increase d \naspartate aminotransferase (0.8%), diarrhea (0.4%) and alopecia (0.4%). Overa ll, 10.5% of patients had \ninterstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis related to treatment as determined by an independent \nadjudication committee. The majority of ILD events (9.7%) were low grade (grade 1 (2.7%) or grade 2 \n(7.0%)) with two grade 3 (0.8% ) events reported. No grade 4 or grade 5 ILD or pneumonitis events occurred.\n3 \n  \nAbout DESTINY -Breast03   \nDESTINY -Breast03 is a global, head -to-head, randomized, open -label, pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan  (5.4 mg/kg) versus T -DM1 in patients with HER2 positive \nunresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane. The primary \nefficacy endpoint of DESTINY -Breast03 is PFS based on blinded independent central review. Secon dary \nendpoints include OS, ORR, duration of response, PFS based on investigator assessment and safety. \nDESTINY -Breast03 enrolled 524 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and \nSouth America.  Results from DESTINY -Breast03 have been published in The New England Journal of \nMedicine . For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.7 More than two million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020, with nearly 685,000 \ndeaths globally.7 In Europe, more than 530,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually.1 \nApproximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.2 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers.8 HER2 protein overexpres sion may occur as a \nresult of HER2 gene amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in \nbreast cancer.9 \n \nDespite initial treatment with trastuzumab , pertuzumab  and a taxane , patients with HER2 positive metastatic \nbreast cancer will often experience disease progression. 3,4 More treatment options are needed to further \ndelay progression and extend survival .3,5,6 \n \nAbout Trastuzumab Deruxtecan  \nTrastuzumab deruxtecan  is a HER2 directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC \ntechnology, trastuzumab deruxtecan  is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the \nmost advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.

    "content": "Press Release  \n \nTrastuzumab Deruxtecan Type II Variation Application Validated by \nEMA for Patients with HER2 Low Metastatic Breast Cancer with HR \nPositive and HR Negative Disease  \n \n• Application based on DESTINY- Breast04 results that showed Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s \ntrastuzumab deruxtecan demonstrated superior progression- free and overall survival versus \nchemotherapy  \n \nTokyo and Munich – ( June  22, 2022)  – Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) today announced that the European \nMedicines Agency (EMA) has validated the Type II Variation application for trastuzumab deruxtecan as \nmonotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 low  \n(immunohistochemistry ( IHC) 1+ or IHC 2+/ in-situ hybridization ( ISH)-negative) breast cancer who have \nreceived a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherap y. Patients with hormone receptor (HR) positive breast \ncancer must  additionally have received or be ineligible for endocrine therapy. \n Trastuzumab deruxtecan is a specifically engineered HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being \njointly developed and commercialized by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN).  \n Validation confirms that the application is complete and commences the scientific review process by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). This  application is based on data from \nthe DESTINY -Breast04  phase 3 trial recently presented  at the plenary session of the American Society of \nClinical Oncology ( #ASCO22) Annual Meeting and simultaneously published in The New England Journal \nof Medicine .  \n \n“Trastuzumab deruxtecan is the first HER2 directed therapy to demonstrate a survival benefit in patients with \nHER2 low metastatic breast cancer . We now have the potential to redefine how we classify and treat \napproximately half of all  metastatic  breast cancers,”  said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice \nPresident, Global Head, Oncology Clinical Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “In addition to the ongoing review of two other applications for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive metastatic \nbreast cancer or gastric cancer  in Europe , we are pleased  to have received this third validation for HER2 low \nmetastatic breast cancer with the goal of bringing trastuzumab deruxtecan to as many eligible patients with \nHER2 targetable cancers as possible. ”\n2 \n In DESTINY -Breast04,  trastuzumab deruxtecan demonstrated superior and clinically meaningful efficacy in \nprogression- free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in previously treated  patients with HER2 low  \nunresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer  with HR positive or HR negative disease versus standard of care \nphysician’s choice of chemotherapy. The safety profile of trastuzumab deruxtecan was consistent with \nprevious clinical trials with no new safety concerns identified. Interstitial lung d isease (ILD) or pneumonitis \nrates were consistent with that observed in late- line HER2 positive breast cancer trials of trastuzumab \nderuxtecan  with a lower rate of grade 5 ILD observed, as determined by an independent adjudication \ncommittee.  \n \nAbout DESTIN Y-Breast04   \nDESTINY -Breast04 is a global, randomized, open-label, pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and \nsafety of trastuzumab deruxtecan (5.4 mg/kg) versus physician’s choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel) in patients with HR positive or HR negative, unresectable \nand/or metastatic breast cancer with low HER2 expression previously treated with one or two prior lines of \nchemotherapy. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either trastuzumab deruxtecan or chemotherapy.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY- Breast04 is PFS in patients with HR positive disease based on blinded \nindependent central review (BICR). Key secondary endpoints include PFS based on BICR in all randomized patients (HR positive and HR negative disease), OS in patients with HR positive disease and OS in all randomized patients (HR positive and HR negative disease). Other secondary endpoints include PFS based on investigator assessment, objective response rate based on BICR and on investigator assessment, duration of response based on BICR and safety. DESTINY -Breast04 enrolled 557  patients at multiple sites in Asia, \nEurope and North America. For more information about the trial, visit \nClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Breast Cancer and HER2 Expression \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.1 More than two million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020 resulting in nearly \n685,000 deaths globally.1 In Europe, approximately 531,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually.2 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers, and is one of many biomarkers expressed in \nbreast cancer tumors.3 \n \nHER2 expression is currently defined as either positive or negative, and is determined by an IHC test which \nestimates the amo unt of HER2 protein on a cancer cell, and/or an ISH test, which  counts the copies of the \nHER2 gene in cancer cells.3,4 HER2 positive cancers are defined as IHC 3+, IHC 2+/ISH+.3 HER2 negative \ncancers are currently defined as IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-.3 Approximately half of all patients with\n3 \n breast cancer  have tumors with a HER2 IHC score of 1+, or a HER2 IHC score of 2+ in combination with a \nnegative ISH test, an expression level not currently eligible for HER2 targeted therapy.5,6,7,8 Low HER2 \nexpression occurs in both HR positive and HR negative disease.9  \n \nHER2 testing is routinely used to determine appropriate treatment options for patients with metastatic breast \ncancer. Targeting the lower range of expression in the HER2 spectrum may offer another approach to delay \ndisease progression and extend survival in pat ients with metastatic breast cancer.10 Currently, patients with \nlow HER2 expression with HR positive tumors have limited treatment options following progression on \nendocrine (hormone) therapy.11 Few targeted  options are available for those who are HR negative.12 \n \nAbout Trastuzumab Deruxtecan  \nTrastuzumab deruxtecan (fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed ADC. \nDesigned using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, trastuzumab deruxtecan is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific platform. Trastuzumab deruxtecan consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a \ntopoisomerase I inhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n Trastuzumab deruxtecan (5.4  mg/kg) is approved in Canada, Israel and the U.S. for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimen either in the metastatic setting, or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy, based on results from the DESTINY -\nBreast03  trial. Trastuzumab deruxtecan  also is approved in approximately 40 countries for the treatm ent of \nadult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more \nprior anti -HER2 -based regimens based on the results from the  DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n \nTrastuzumab deruxtecan (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  \ntrial.  \n About the Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab \nderuxtecan monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and \ncolorectal cancers. Trials in combination with other  anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also  are \nunderway.\n4 \n Regulatory applications for t rastuzumab deruxtecan are currently under review in China, Europe , Japan  and \nseveral other countries for the treatment of adu lt patients with HER2 positive unresectable or metastatic \nbreast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based  regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -\nBreast03  trial.  \n \nTrastuzumab deruxtecan also is currently under review in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a HER2 ( ERBB2 ) mutation and who have received a \nprior systemic therapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Lung01 trial, and in Europe  for the treatment \nof adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior anti- HER2 -based regimen based on the DESTINY -Gastric01  and DESTINY -Gastric02  \ntrials.  \n \nTrastuzumab deruxtecan  was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the U.S. for the treatment of \nadult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH- negative) breast cancer \nwho have received a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during \nor within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results of the DESTINY -Breast04  \ntrial.

Results will be  presented during the Plenary \nSession  (#LBA3) today at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (#ASCO22) Annual Meeting and have \nbeen simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine .  \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2  directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly \ndeveloped and commercialized  by Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) . \n In the primary endpoint analysis for  DESTINY -Breast04, ENHERTU  demonstrated  a 49% reduction in the \nrisk of disease progression or death versus physician’s choice of chemotherapy in patients with HER2 low metastatic breast cancer with HR positive disease (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.51 ; 95% confidence interval [ CI]: \n0.40-0.64; p<0.001). A m edian PFS of 10.1 months (9.5- 11.5) was seen in patients treated with ENHERTU \ncompared to 5.4 months (4.4-7.1) with chemotherapy, a s assessed by  blinded independent central review \n(BICR) . \n Results also showed a 36%  reduction in the risk of death with ENHERTU compared to chemotherapy in \npatients with HR positive disease (HR =  0.64; 95% CI: 0.48-0.86; p =0.003) with a median OS  of 23.9 \nmonths with ENHERT U (95% CI: 20.8-24.8) versus 17.5 months with  chemotherapy (95% CI: 15.2-22.4), \nmeeting a key secondary endpoint of the trial . Confirmed objective response rate (ORR) more than \ntripled  in the ENHERTU arm versus the chemotherapy arm (52.6% [n=175/333; 95% CI: 47.0-58.0 %]\n2 \n versus 16.3%  [n=27 /166; 95% CI: 11.0- 22.8% ], respectively ). Twelve (3.6%) complete responses (CR) and \n164 (49.2%) partial responses (PR) were observed in patients with HR positive disease treated with \nENHERTU compared to one (0.6%) CR and 26 (15.7%) PRs in those treated with chemothe rapy. Median \nduration of response was 10.7 months for ENHERTU  versus 6.8 months for chemotherapy.  \n \n“The results of DESTINY -Breast04 show for the first time that a HER2 directed therapy can provide a \nsurvival benefit to patients with low HER2 expression, indicat ing we must reconsider  the way we categorize \npatients with metastatic breast cancer ,” said Shanu Modi, MD, medical oncologist, Memorial Sloan Kettering \nCancer Center  and principal investigator for the trial. “The efficacy  seen with ENHER TU also reinforces the \npotential to establish a new standard of care for more than half of all patients with breast cancer currently \ncategori zed as having HER2 negative disease, but who actually  have  tumors with  low HER2 expression.”  \n \nAdditionally, data sh owed  consistent efficacy for ENHERTU  in the overall trial population of patients with \nHER2  low metastatic breast cancer with HR  positive or HR  negative disease and across levels of HER2 \nexpression ( both IHC1+ and IHC 2+/ISH -). In the key secondary endpoint  analysis of PFS by BICR in  all \npatients, a similar  50%  reduction in the  risk of disease progression or death  was observed between \nENHERTU and chemotherapy (HR = 0.50; 95% CI:0.40- 0.63; p<0.001) , with a m edian PFS of 9.9 months \n(9.0- 11.3)  for ENHERTU  versus 5.1 months (4.2- 6.8) in those treated with chemotherapy. Results of the key \nsecondary endpoint of OS in all patients also showed a m edian OS  of 23.4 months (20.0- 24.8) for \nENHERTU versus 16.8 months (14.5- 20.0) with chemotherapy (HR=0.64; 95% CI: 0.49- 0.84; p=0.001) , \nwith c onfirmed ORR more than tripled  in the ENHERTU arm (52.3% [ n=195/373; 95% CI: 47.1- 57.4% ]) \nversus those treated  with chemotherapy ( 16.3% [ n=30/184; 95% CI: 11. 3-22.5% ]).  \n \nIn an exploratory analysis of patients with H R negative disease, median PFS was 8.5 months (4.3- 11.7) with  \nENHERTU versus 2.9 months (1.4- 5.1) with chemotherapy (HR=0.46; 95% CI: 0.24- 0.89) . Median OS was \n18.2 months (13.6- NE) with  ENHERTU versus 8.3 months (5.6- 20.6) with chemotherapy (HR=0.48; 95%CI: \n0.24- 0.95). Confirmed ORR was 50% with ENHERTU (n=20 /40; 95% CI: 33.8- 66.2%) versus 16.7% with \nchemotherapy (n=3/18 ; 95% CI: 3.6- 41.4%).  \n \nThe safety profile of ENHERTU was consistent with previous clinical trials with no new safety concerns \nidentified . The most common grade 3 or higher treatment emergent adverse events were  neutropenia \n(13.7%), anemia (8.1%), leukopenia (6.5%), fatigue ( 7.5%), thrombocytopenia (5.1%), nausea (4.6%), \nincreased aminotransferase  (3.2%), decreased appetite (2.4%), vomiting (1.3%) and diarrhea (1.1 %). \nInterstitial lung disease (ILD)  or pneumonitis  rates were consistent with that observed in late- line HER2 \npositive br east cancer trials of ENHERTU with a lower rate of grade 5 ILD observed, as determined by an \nindependent adjudication committee. Overall, 12.1% of patients had confirmed ILD or pneumonitis related to \ntreatment  as determined by an independent adjudication c ommittee . The  majority of ILD  events (10%) were\n3 \n primarily low grade (grade 1 (3.5%) or grade 2 (6.5%)) with five grade 3 (1.3%), no grade 4 and three grade \n5 (0.8%) events reported.  \n “As innovative research organizations, extending the survival for patients is one of our primary goals as we \nseek to identify potential ly new treatment options for patients with metastatic breast cancer ,” said Ken \nTakeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “ These potentially practice- changing data show that \nDESTINY -Breast04  takes  us one step closer to achieving this goal, as ENHERTU i s the first HER2 directed \nmedicine to demonstrate a survival benefit in patients with HER2 low metastatic breast cancer. We are honored by the recognition these important findings are receiving at one of the world’s most prominent oncology meetings as well  as in one of the leading medical journals .”  \n “Today’s results represent  a pivotal moment demonstrating the potential for ENHERTU  to redefin e the \ntreatment of HER2 targetable cancers,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology  R&D, AstraZeneca. “DESTINY -Breast04  validates targeting the lower end of the spectrum of \nHER2 expression, since ENHERTU reduced the risk of disease progression or death across all types of \npatients in the trial by half  and reduced the risk of death by over  a third . We must now evolve  the way we \nclassify and treat metastatic breast cancer  to ensure these patients are effectively  diagnosed and treated.”   \n All patients in DESTINY -Breast04 received at least one prior cancer ther apy, including targeted therapy \n(ENHERTU = 279; chemotherapy = 140), a CDK4/6 inhibitor (ENHERTU = 239; chemotherapy = 119), endocrine therapy (ENHERTU = 347; chemotherapy = 165), chemotherapy (ENHERTU = 373; \nchemotherapy = 183). T he median lines of prior systemic therapies in the metastatic setting were three  (range \n1-9). A  prior CDK4/6 inhibitor was received by 70% of hormone receptor positive patients (ENHERTU = \n233/331; chemotherapy = 115/163). As of data cut -off on January 11, 2022, 58 patients remained on \ntreatment with ENHERTU and 3 patients on chemotherapy.  \n \nSummary of  DESTINY- Breast04 Results  \n \nEfficacy \nMeasure  HR Positive (n=494)  All Patients (n=557)  HR Negative (n=58)i \n \nENHERTU \n(5.4 mg/kg) \n(n=331)  Chemotherapy \n(n=163) ENHERTU \n(5.4 mg/kg) \n(n=373) Chemotherapy  \n(n=184) ENHERTU \n(5.4 mg/kg) \n(n=40) Chemotherapy  \n(n=18) \nMedian PFS \n(months) \n(95% CI)ii  10.1 months \n(9.5- 11.5)  5.4 months  \n(4.4- 7.1) 9.9 months  \n(9.0- 11.3)  5.1 months  \n(4.2- 6.8) 8.5 months  \n(4.3- 11.7)  2.9 months  \n(1.4- 5.1) \nHR=0.51 (0.40 -0.64)  \np<0.001  HR=0.50 (0.40 -0.63)  \np<0.001  HR=0.46 (0.24 -0.89)\n4 \n Median OS \n(months)  \n(95% CI)  23.9 months \n(20.8-24.8) 17.5 months \n(15.2-22.4) 23.4 months  \n(20.0-24.8)  16.8 months  \n(14.5-20.0) 18.2 months \n(13.6- NE) 8.3 months  \n(5.6-20.6) \nHR=0.64 (0.48 -0.86)  \np=0.003 HR=0.64 (0.49 -0.84)  \np=0.001 HR=0.48 (0.24 -0.95)  \nConfirmed \nORR (%)  \n(95% CI)ii,iii  52.6% \n(47.0-58.0) 16.3%  \n(11.0-22.8) 52.3%  \n(47.1-57.4) 16.3%  \n(11.3-22.5) 50.0%  \n(33.8-66.2) 16.7%  \n(3.6-41.4) \nCR (%)  3.6% 0.6% 3.5%  1.1%  2.5%  5.6%  \nPR (%)  49.2% 15.7%  49.1%  15.2%  47.5%  11.1%  \nSD (%)  35.1%  50.0%  34.6%  49.5%  30.0%  44.4%  \nPD (%)  \n(95% CI)  7.8%  21.1%  8.3%  22.3%  12.5%  33.3%  \nMedian \nDoR \n(months)ii 10.7 months  6.8 months  10.7 months  6.8 months  8.6 months  4.9 months  \nCBR (%)ii,iv 71.2%  34.3%  70.2%  33.7%  62.5%  27.8%  \nDCR (%)v 88.0%  66.3%  87.1%  65.8%  80.0%  61.1%  \nCI, confidence interval; CBR, clinical benefit rate; CR, complete response; DCR, disease control rate; DoR, duration of response; HR, hazard ratio; \nNE, not evaluable ; ORR, overall response rate; OS, overall survival; PD, progressive disease; PFS, progression -free survival; PR, partial response; \nSD, stable disease  \ni For the primary  endpoint (PFS in the HR positive cohort)  and key secondary endpoints  (PFS among all patients and OS in the HR positive  cohort and \namong all patients) , the HR  status is based on data collected with the use of  the interactive Web response and voice response system at the time of \nrandomization, which includes  patients who were  mis-stratified.

Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either ENHERTU or chemotherapy.   \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY- Breast04 is PFS in patients with HR positive disease  based on blinded \nindependent central review (BICR). Key secondary endpoints include PFS based on BICR in all randomized patients (HR positive and HR negative disease), OS in patients with HR positive disease and OS in all randomized patients (HR positive and HR negative disease ). Other secondary endpoints include PFS based \non investigator assessment, objective response rate based on BICR and on investigator assessment, duration of response based on BICR and safety.  \n DESTINY -Breast04 enrolled 5 57 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America.

Targeting the lower range of expression in the HER2 spectrum may offer another approach to delay disease progression and extend survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer.\n9 Currently, patients with \nlow HER2 expression with HR positive tumors have limited treatment options following progression on \nendocrine (hormone) therapy.10 Few targeted options are available for those who are HR negative.11  \n About ENHERTU ENHERTU\n® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 \ndirected ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced pr ogram in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific platform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide- based cleavable linker.  \n ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. and Israel for the treatment of adult patients  with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen \neither in the metastatic setting, or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy, based on results from the DESTINY -Breast03  \ntrial. ENHERTU is also approved in approximately 40 countries for the treat ment of adult patients with\n6 \n unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please s ee the accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide . \n About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program A comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway. \n  \nRegulatory applications for ENHERTU are currently under review in  China,  Europe , Japan  and several other \ncountries for the treatment of adult patients with  unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive  breast cancer who \nhave received a prior anti-H ER2-based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY- Breast03  trial. \n \nENHERTU was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -negative) breast c ancer who have \nreceived a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within \nsix months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy based on the results of the DESTINY- Breast04  trial.  \nPatients with hormone receptor (HR) positive breast cancer should additionally have received or be ineligible \nfor endocrine therapy.  \nENHERTU also is currently under review in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a HER2 (ERBB2 ) mutation and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Lung01 trial, and in Europe  for the treatment of adult \npatients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior anti -HER2 based regimen based on the DESTINY -Gastric01  and DESTINY -Gastric02  trials.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (referred to as Daiichi Sankyo) and AstraZeneca entered into a global \ncollaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan\n7 \n (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo \nis responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan. \n U.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU\n \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based \nregimen either:  \n– In the metastati c setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six \nmonths of completing therapy  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received  a prior trastuzumab -based regimen  \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY  \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \nContraindications  \nNone. \n \nWarnings and Precautions \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor pa tients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected  \n(e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), \npermanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as \nILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 \ndays followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks. \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 491 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 13% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 1.4% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (range: 1.1 \nto 20.8).\n8 \n Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients wi th locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to \nfirst onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2  to 21.0). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC < 1.0 x \n109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 491 patients with unresectable or metastatic HE R2-positive breast cancer who \nreceived ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 68% of patients. Eighteen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 days (range: 6 to 664). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.2% of patients. \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with EN HERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% \nof patients. Fifty-one percent had Grade 3 or  4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of \npatients.  \n Left Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, in cluding \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue tr eatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment \nwithin 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40- 45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repea t LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from \nbaseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume \ntreatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease f rom baseline is \n>20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic conges tive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU \nhas not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn the 491 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU 5.4 \nmg/kg, 13 cases (2.6%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported.   \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU  6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were \nreported; however, on echocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.\n9 \n Embryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise femal es of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \nat least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nThe pooled safety population for patients with metastatic breast cancer reflects expo sure to ENHERTU at 5.4 \nmg/kg given as an intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks (21-day cycle) in 491 patients in DESTINY-Breast03, DESTINY -Breast01, and Study DS8201-A-J101. The median duration of treatment was 13 months \n(range: 0.7 to 37). In this poole d safety population, the most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including \nlaboratory abnormalities, were nausea (78%), decreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased hemoglobin \n(68%), decreased neutrophil count (68%), increased aspartate aminotransferase  (58%), fatigue  (57%), \ndecreased lymphocyte count (56%), vomiting  (50%), decreased platelet count (49%), increased alanine \naminotransferase (48%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase  (45%), alopecia  (41%), constipation (35%), \nhypokalemia (33%), decreased appetite  (32%), diarrhea (31%), musculoskeletal pain  (28%), increased \ntransaminases (27%), respiratory infection  (24%), headache (21%), and abdominal pain (21%).  \n \nDESTINY-Breast03 The safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 257 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast \ncancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY- Breast03. ENHERTU was \nadministered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 14 \nmonths (range: 0.7 to 30).  \n Serio us adverse reactions occurred in 19% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were vomiting, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, pyrexia, and urinary tract infection. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients including COVID-19 \nand sudden death (one patient each). \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 14% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis accounted for 8%. \nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 44% of pa tients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, pneumonia, nausea, fatigue, and ILD/pneumonitis. Dose reductions occurred in 21% of \npatients tr eated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction \nwere nausea, neutropenia, and fatigue. \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (76%), decreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (70%), increased aspartate \naminotransferase (67%), decreased hemoglobin (64%), decreased lymphocyte count (55%), increased alanine aminotransferase (53%), decreased platelet count (52%), fatigue (49%), vomiting (49%), increased blood \nalkaline phosphatase (49%), alopecia (37%), hypokalemia (35%), constipation (34%), musculoskeletal pain (31%), diarrhea (29%), decreased appetite (29%), respiratory infection (22%), headache (22%), abdominal pain \n(21%), increased blood bilirubin (20%), and stomatitis (20%).\n10 \n Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in DESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intraven ously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly \nor paclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5  to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \n Serious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in \n2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred in one patient each (0.8%).  \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactio ns (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of pa tients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalit ies, were decreased hemoglobin \n(75%), decreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (72%), decreased lymphocyte count \n(70%), decreased platelet count (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), increased aspartate \naminotransferase ( 58%), fatigue (55%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (54%), increased alanine \naminotransferase (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), increased blood bilirubin (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%). \n Use in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant wi thin 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use \neffective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. \nMales : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception \nduring treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU \nmay impair male reproductive function and fertility. \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. \n• Geriatric Use: Of  the 491 patients with HER2- positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \n22% were ≥65 years and 4% were  ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were \nobserved between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (60%) as co mpared to younger patients \n(49%). Of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ \nadenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% \nwere ≥75  years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of \nage compared to younger patients.  \n• Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moder ate or severe renal impairment.\n11 \n • Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1- 877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Informat ion, including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout  Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our world-\nclass science and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the \nworld.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular disease, Daiichi \nSankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as well as other diseases \nwith high unmet medical needs.

These data will be presented  during an oral \npresentation (Abstract #1002) and  a poster discussion session (Abstract # 9017) at the American Society of \nClinical Oncology (#ASCO22) Annual Meeting.  \n \nPatritumab deruxtecan is a potential first- in-class HER3 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered \nand being developed by Daiichi Sankyo.  \n Advanced breast and lung cancer are two of the leading causes of cancer -related death in the U.S. with five -\nyear survival rates  of 30% and 7%, respectively .\n1,2 New therapeutic approaches are needed to improve \noutcomes for these cancers and HER3 is a promising target for therapeutic development . HER3  is broadly \nexpressed in these tumors  and is  associated with an increased incidence of metastases, reduced survival and \nis one of the mechanis ms of resistance to standard of care treatment.3,4 \n \n“Results of these two trials  of patritumab  deruxtecan  in patients with certain subtypes of advanced breast or \nlung cancer  further support the potential of Daiichi  Sankyo’s DXd antibody drug conjugate technology \nacross different types of cancer,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global \nHead, Oncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “These  data also reinforce the potential \nemerging role of targeting HER3 with an antibody drug conjugate to overcome resistance  to standard of care \ntreatment in patients with HER3 expressing metastatic breast cancer as well as in patients  with advanced  \nnon-small cell lung cancer  without EGFR activating mutations , which we plan to continue to explore in \nadditional trials.”\n2 \n HER3  Expressing Metastatic Breast Cancer  Results \nPooled analysis from a three -part, first -in-human phase 1/2 trial evaluating patritumab deruxtecan (n=182) \nshowed clinically meaningful and durable responses after a median follow -up of 31.9 months (range, 15- 56) \nin patients with three different subtypes of HER3 expressing metastatic breast cancer, including HR \npositive/HER2 negative, triple negative and HER2 positive disease. Responses were seen across a broad \nrange of HER3 expression.  \n \nA confirmed objective response rate (ORR) of 30.1% (95% CI: 21.8- 39.4)  was observed with patritumab \nderuxtecan in the cohort of 113 patients with HER3 high or  HER3 low, HR positive/HER2 negative \nmetastatic breast cancer , as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Partial responses (PRs) \nwere observed in 30.1% of patients and 50.4% of patients had a best overall response  (BOR)  of stable \ndisease  (SD) . Median duration of response (DOR) was at 7.2 months (95% C I: 5.3- NE). Median progression -\nfree survival (PFS) was 7.4 months (95% CI: 4.7- 8.4) and median overall survival (OS) was 14.6 months \n(95% CI: 11.3- 19.5).  \n \nIn the cohort of 53 patients  with HER3 high metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), an ORR o f \n22.6% (95% CI: 12.3- 36.2) was observed with patritumab deruxtecan,  as assessed by BICR. PRs were \nobserved in 22.6% of patients and 56.6% of patients  had a BOR of SD . Median DOR  was 5.9 months (95% \nCI: 3.0-8.4).  Median PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI: 3.9- 6.8) and the median OS was 14.6 months (95% CI: \n11.2- 17.2).  \n \nAn ORR of 42.9% (95% CI: 17.7- 71.1) was observed with patritumab deruxtecan in the cohort of  14 patients \nwith HER3  high, HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer , as assessed by BICR. PRs were observed in 42.9% \nof patients and 50.0 % of patients  had a BOR of SD . Median DOR was 8.3 months (95% CI: 2.8- 26.4). \nMedian PFS was 11.0 months (95% CI: 4.4- 16.4) and median OS was at 19.5 months (95% CI: 12.2- NE). \n \"Significan t unmet need still remains for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer and new \ntreatment strategies need to be continuously explored,\" said Ian E. Krop, MD, PhD, Chief Clinical Research \nOfficer, Associate Cancer Center Director for Clinical  Research, Yale Cancer Center. “Results from this trial \nshow  that patritumab deruxtecan produces clinically meaningful and durable antitumor activity in patients \nand further study is warranted to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of this HER3 direct ed antibody drug \nconjugate across patients with HR positive/HER2 negative, HER2 positive and triple negative breast cancer.”  \n \nPooled safety was analyzed for all patients (n=182) enrolled in the trial . Treatment -emergent adverse events \n(TEAEs ) associated with treatment discontinuation was 9.9%. Treatment -related Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs occurred\n3 \n in 120 patients ( 65.9% ) and included neutrophil count dec rease, platelet count decrease, white blood cell \ncount decrease, anemia,  alanine aminotransferase increase, aspartate aminotransferase increase, decreased \nappetite, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, malaise , stomatitis and vomiting . Overall, 12 patients (6.6%) had \nconfirmed treatment -related interstitial lung disease (ILD ) or pneumonitis as determined by an independent \nadjudication committee. Most ILD events were low -grade with three (1.6%) grade 1 and five (2.7%) grade 2 \nevents ; three grade 3 (1.6%) and one grade 5 (death) event occurred  (0.5%) . \n \nPatients were heavily pre -treated , and those  with HR positive/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer had \nreceiv ed a median of six (range, 2- 13) prior lines of therapy in the advanced setting ; patients with metastatic \nTNBC had receiv ed a median of two (range, 1- 13) prior therapies ; and patients with HER2 positive breast \ncancer had receiv ed a median of 5.5 (range, 2- 11) prior therapies. Median treatment duration was 5.9 months \n(range, 0.7- 30.6). As of the data cut -off on August 16, 2021, four patients remained on study treatment with \npatritumab deruxtecan.  \n \nSummary of Results  of HER3 Expressing Breast Cancer Phase 1/2 Trial  \n \nEfficacy Measures  HR positive / \nHER2  negative  \nHER3 high and  \nHER3 low \nn=113 TNB C \nHER3 high  \nn=53 HER2  positive  \nHER3 high  \nn=14 \nConfirmed ORR , % \n(95% CI)i 30.1% (21.8 -39.4)  22.6% (12.3 -36.2)  42.9% (17.7 -71.1)  \nConfirmed BOR  \n     PR, % (n) 30.1%  (34) 22.6%  (12) 42.9%  (6) \n     SD, % (n) 50.4%  (57) 56.6%  (30) 50.0%  (7) \n     PD, % (n) 11.5%  (13) 17.0%  (9) 7.1%  (1) \n     NE, % (n) 8.0%  (9) 3.8% (2) 0% (0)  \nDOR, median  (95% CI), \nmonths  7.2 months   \n(5.3-Not Estimable)  5.9 months (3.0- 8.4) 8.3 months (2.8- 26.4)  \nPFS, median (95% CI), \nmonths  7.4 months (4.7- 8.4) 5.5 months (3.9- 6.8) 11.0 months (4.4- 16.4)  \n6-month PFS rate , % \n(95% CI)  53.5% (43.4- 62.6)  38.2% (24.2- 52.0)  51.6% (22.1- 74.8)  \nOS, median  (95% CI), \nmonths  14.6  months  (11.3- 19.5)  14.6 months (11.2- 17.2)  19.5 months  \n(12.2 -Not Estimable) \nBOR, best overall response; DOR, duration of response; HER, human epidermal growth factor receptor; HR, hormone receptor;  \nORR, objective response rate; OS, overall survival; PD, progressive disease; PFS, progression -free survival; PR, partial response; \nSD, stable disease; NE, not evaluable; TNBC, triple  negative breast cancer  \ni 95% exact binomial confidence interval using Clopper -Pearson method\n4 \n NSCLC Without Common EGFR -Activating Mutations  Results  \nFirst preliminary results from one cohort of an ongoing phase 1 trial  reported durable responses  with \npatritumab deruxtecan after a medi an follow -up of 19.7 months (range, 13.8- 29.2) in patients  with locally  \nadvanced  or metastatic NSCLC without most frequent  EGFR activating mutations  (EX19del, L858R, L861Q \nor G719X) or without identified driver genomic alterations.  \n \nAn ORR of 28.6% (95% CI: 11.3- 52.2) , as assessed by BICR,  was observed  with patritumab  deruxtecan in \n21 patients with advanced NSCLC with identified driver genomic alterations  other than EGFR activating \nmutations.  Six patients had  PRs and 10 patients had a best overall response of stable disease . Median DOR \nwas 9.4 months (95% CI: 4.2- NE) and a  disease control rate (DCR) of 76.2% (95% CI: 52.8- 91.8)  was \nobserved.  Median PFS was 10.8 months  (95% CI: 2.8- 16.0) . Responses with patritumab deruxtecan were \nseen in patients with a broad range of driver genomic alterations, including KRAS/NRAS mutations  and \nALK  fusions . \n In patients with NSCL C without identified driver genomic alterations, an ORR of 26.9% (95% CI: 11.6 -47.8) \nwas observed with patritumab deruxtecan in 26 patients, as assessed by BICR. One patient had a complete \nresponse  (CR) , six had PRs and 12 patients had stable disease as  a best overall response. Median DOR was \n9.6 months (95% CI: 1.6- NE) and a  DCR of 73.1% (95% CI: 52.2- 88.4) was observed . \n \n“Similar to previously reported results in patients with EGFR mutated non -small cell lung cancer, patritumab \nderuxtecan show s promising durable responses  in patients with heavily pretreated advanced non- small cell \nlung cancer with or without dr iver genomic alterations,” said Conor E. Steuer, MD,  Assistant Professor, \nDepartment of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University  School of Medicine.  “Further research \nis warranted to further confirm  whether targeting HER3 is an effective treatment strategy to overcome \ntreatment resistance in these patients.”  \n \nSafety  of patritumab deruxtecan seen in this cohort was consistent with that  previously observed in patients \nwith EGFR -mutated NSCLC. Treatment -related Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs  occurred in 24 patients ( 51.1% ) and \nincluded neutropenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, hypokalemia, anemia, leukopenia and pneumonia. Five \npatients (10.6%) had confirmed treatment -related IL D as determined by an independent adjudication \ncommittee . Most of these ILD events were low -grade with one grade 1 (2.1%) and four grade 2 (8.5%)  \nevents . As of data cut -off of January 28, 2022, f ive p atients (10.6%) remained on treatment with patritumab \nderuxtecan .\n5 \n About the Phase 1/2 Breast Cancer Trial  \nThe global, open- label, three- part phase 1/2 trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of patritumab \nderuxtecan in patients with HER3 expressing advanced/unresectable metastatic breast cancer who are \nrefractory or intolerant to standard treatment, or for whom  no standard treatment is available.   \n The dose escalation part of the trial is assessing  the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of patritumab \nderuxtecan to determine the maximum tolerated dose. The dose finding part of the trial assessed the safety \nand efficacy of patritumab deruxtecan at s elected dosing levels to determine the recommended dose for \nexpansion. Patients in the dose escalation and dose finding parts of the trial must have received six or fewer \nprior chemotherapy regimens, at least two of which were administered for treatment of  \nadvanced/unresectable metastatic disease, and at least one prior chemotherapeutic regimen must have \nincluded a taxane, administered in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or advanced setting.   \n \nThe phase 2 part of the trial is evaluating  the safety and efficacy of patritumab deruxtecan at the \nrecommended dose for expansion in four different cohorts of patients with HER3 expressing and HER2 \nnegative locally advanced  or metastatic breast cancer, including  HR positive and triple negative breast \ncancer.  For more information, visit  ClinicalTrials.gov .\n \n About the Phase 1 Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer Trial   \nThe global, multicenter, open label, two- part phase 1 trial is evaluating patritumab deruxtecan in previously \ntreated patients with metastatic or unresectable NSCLC.  \n The dose escalation part of the trial is evaluating  patients with EGFR -mutated disease either with progression \non osimertinib or T790M -negative after progression on erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib. The primary objective \nof this part of the trial was to assess the safety and tolerability of patritumab derux tecan and determine the \nrecommended dose for expansion (RDE).  \n \nThe dose expansion part of the trial is evaluating  patritumab deruxtecan at the RDE (5.6 mg/kg every three \nweeks) in three cohorts. Cohort 1 includes patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR -mutated \nNSCLC who experienced disease progression after taking one or more EGFR TKIs and one or more platinum -based chemotherapy regimens. Cohort 2 includes patients with squamous or non- squamous \nNSCLC without EGFR -activating mutations  following pla tinum- based chemotherapy and following an anti -\nPD-1 or anti -PD-L1 antibody regimen. Cohort 3 includes patients with NSCLC with EGFR -activating \nmutations including any histology other than combined small cell and non- small cell lung cancer; patients in\n6 \n Cohort 3 are randomized 1:1 to receive the 5.6 mg/kg RDE regimen (Cohort 3a) or an escalating up- titration \nregimen of patritumab deruxtecan (Cohort 3b).  \n The primary objective of the dose expansion part of the trial is to assess efficacy of patritumab deruxtecan as \nmeasured by confirmed objective response rate (ORR) assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary trial endpoints include investigator -assessed ORR, safety and pharmacokinetics. The trial enroll ed \npatients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America.

View the full release here. \n The approval  by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was  based on positive results from the \npivotal DESTINY -Breast03  phase 3 trial  that showed ENHERTU reduced the risk of disease progression or \ndeath by 72% versus  trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1 ) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28; 95% confidence interval \n[CI]: 0.22- 0.37; p<0.0001) in patients with HER2 positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer \npreviousl y treated with trastuzumab and a taxane . The median progression -free survival (PFS) for patients \ntreated with ENHERTU was not reached (95% CI: 18.5- NE) compared to 6.8 months for T -DM1 (95% CI: \n5.6-8.2) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BI CR).  \n \nThe approval was granted under the FDA’s Real -Time Oncology Review (RTOR) program following the \nrecent Priority Review  and Breakthrough Therapy Designation of ENHERTU in  the U.S in this earlier \ndisease setting. The previously  granted  accelerated approval  of ENHERTU in later line HER2 positive \nmetastatic breast cancer is now con verted to regular approval, broadening its breast cancer indication in the \nU.S. to earlier lines of use in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.\n2 As part of Project Orbis , ENHERTU also is under regulatory review for the same indication by the \nAustralian Therapeutic Goods Administration, Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) , Health \nCanada, Israel ’s Ministry of Health Pharmaceutical Administration, and Switzerland’s Swissmedic.   \n \n“ENHERTU has demonstrated si gnificant progression- free survival in the earlier metastatic setting,  \npotentially establishing it as a new standard of care in previously treated patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer,” said Erika Hamilton, MD, Director, Breast Cancer and G ynecological Cancer \nResearch Program, Sarah Cannon Research Institute, Nashville, Tennessee. “Today’s approval is an \nimportant milestone for the clinical community as we will now be able to offer ENHERTU to these patients earlier in their treatment.”  \n “This is an important day for the breast cancer community,” said Catherine Ormerod, Executive Vice \nPresident, Strategy and Mission, Living Beyond Breast Cancer. “With this approval, ENHERTU now provides a new treatment option for patients with HER2 positive me tastatic breast cancer , which can be used \nearlier in treatment to potentially delay progression of disease.”  \n Additional results from the DESTINY -Breast03 phase 3 trial  showed that  confirmed objective response rate \n(ORR) was more than doubled in the ENHERTU arm ( 82.7%; n=20 5; 95% CI: 77. 4-87.2) versus the T -DM1 \narm ( 36.1%; n=87; 95% CI: 30.0- 42.5). Thirty -nine (15.7%) complete responses (CR) and 166 ( 66.9%) \npartial responses (PR) were observed in patients treated with ENHERTU compared to 20 (8.3%) CRs  and 67 \n(27.8%) PRs in patients treated with T -DM1.  In addition, in the secondary endpoint analysis of PFS as \nassessed by investigator, which was published online in The New England Journal of Medicine , patients \ntreated with ENHERTU had a median PFS of 25.1 months (95% CI: 22.1- NE) compared to 7.2 months (95% \nCI: 6.8- 8.3) for T -DM1 (HR=0.26; 95% CI: 0.20- 0.35). Overall survival (OS) was analyzed but immature at \ntime of data cut -off of May 21, 2021 (HR=0.55 ; 95% CI: 0.36- 0.86). Nearly all patients treated with \nENHERTU were alive at one year (94.1%; 95% CI: 90.3- 96.4) compared to 85.9% of patients treated w ith T -\nDM1 (95% CI: 80.9- 89.7).  \n ENHERTU  is approved with Boxed WARNINGS for interstitial lung disease (ILD)/ pneumonitis and \nEmbryo -Fetal toxicity. The safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 257 patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) in the \nDESTINY -Breast03 trial. The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%), includi ng laboratory \nabnormalities, were nausea, decreased white blood cell count, decreased neutrophil count, increased aspartate aminotransferase, decreased hemoglobin, decreased lymphocyte count, increased alanine aminotransferase, decreased platelet count, fa tigue, vomiting, increased blood alkaline phosphatase, alopecia, hypokalemia, \nconstipation, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, decreased appetite, headache, respiratory infection, abdominal\n3 pain, increased blood bilirubin, and stomatitis.  Of the 28 ILD event s (11%), 0.8% were recorded as grade 3 \nevents. No grade 4 or grade 5 ILD or pneumonitis events were adjudicated as drug -related.  \n \n“Today’s FDA approval , which converts the accelerated approval  of ENHERTU  to regular approval, \nhighlights the importance of the FDA’s accelerated pathway that allows for earlier approval of medicines to \ntreat serious medical conditions such as breast cancer,” said Ken Keller, Global Head, Oncology Business, \nand President and CEO, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. “ Data from DESTINY- Breast03 not only confirmed the results \nof DESTINY -Breast01 but also demonstrated the superiority of ENHERTU in prolonging progression- free \nsurvival compared to T -DM1 in an earlier setting of  HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.”   \n \n“ENHERTU is already established in the later -line treatment of patients with HER2  positive metastatic \nbreast cancer, and we are thrilled that with this approval, patients in the U .S. will now be able to access the \ntransformative potential of ENHERTU  earlier in their treatment ,” said Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice \nPresident, Oncology Business Unit, AstraZeneca. “We look forward to bringing this important, potentially \nparadigm -shifting medicine to even more patients across the globe in an earlier setting  as quickly as \npossible .” \n Based on the DESTINY -Breast03 data, f am-trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki (ENHERTU) recently was added \nto the NCCN Clinical Practical Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines\n®) as the Category 1 preferred \nregimen as secon d-line therapy for recurrent unresectable (local or regional) or stage IV HER2+ disease.1  \n Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca are committed to ensuring that patients in the U.S. who are prescribed ENHERTU can access the medication and receive necessary financial support. Provider and patient support, \nreimbursement and distribution for ENHERTU in the U.S. will be accessible by visiting  \nwww.ENHERTU4U.com  or calling 1- 833-ENHERTU (1 -833-364-3788).  \n  \nPlease visit  www.ENHERTU.com  for full  Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, \nand Medication Guide . \n \nFinancial Considerations  \nFollowing approval in the U.S., an amount of $100 million is due from AstraZeneca to Daiichi Sankyo as a second -line milestone payment in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.   \n \nSales of ENHERTU in the U.S. are recognized by Daiichi Sankyo. For further details on the financial \narrangements, please consult the collaboration agreement from March 2019 .\n4 About DESTINY- Breast03   \nDESTINY -Breast03  is a global, head -to-head, randomized, open- label , pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating  the \nefficacy  and safety  of ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg ) versus T -DM1 in patients with HER2 positive unresectable \nand/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and  a taxane. The primary efficacy \nendpoint of DESTINY- Breast03 is  PFS based on blinded independent central review. Seconda ry endpoints \ninclude overall survival , ORR , duration of response , PFS  based on investigator assessment  and safety . \nDESTINY -Breast03 enrolled 524 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe , North America, Oceania and \nSouth America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is  the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer- related d eaths worldwide  \nand in the U.S.2,3 More than two million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020 with  nearly 685,000 \ndeaths globally .2  In the U.S., more than 290,000 new cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2022, with  more \nthan 43,000 deaths.4 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.5 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers.6 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a \nresult of HER2  gene amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in \nbreast cancer.7 \n \nDespite initial treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane, patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer will often experience disease progression .\n8 More treatment options are needed to further delay progression \nand extend survival .8,9,10 \n About ENHERTU ENHERTU\n® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 \ndirected ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in th e oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific platform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide- based cleavable linker.  \n ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S.  for the treatment of adult patients  with unresectable or \nmetastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen either in the \nmetastatic setting, or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing therapy, based on results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  ENHERTU  is \nalso approved in approximately 40 countries for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or\n5 metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -based regimens \nbased on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see the accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication Guide . \n About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program A comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combination with other anticancer tre atments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway. \n \nRegulatory applications for ENHERTU are currently under review in  China,  Europe , Japan  and several other \ncountries for the treatment of adult patients with  HER2 positive unresectable or metastatic breast cancer who \nhave received a prior anti-HER2 based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY- Breast03  trial.   \n \nENHERTU was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -negative) breast c ancer who have \nreceived a prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy, based on the results of the DESTINY -Breast04  trial.  \nPatients with hormone receptor (HR) positive breast cancer should additionally have received or be ineligible \nfor endocrine therapy.  \nENHERTU also is currently under revi ew in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a HER2 (ERBB2 ) mutation and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Lung01 trial, and in Europe  for the trea tment of adult \npatients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior anti -HER2 based regimen based on the DESTINY -Gastric01  and DESTINY -Gastric02  trials.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (referred to as Daiichi Sankyo) and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan\n6 (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. \nDaiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan. \n \nImportant Safety Information \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based \nregimen either:  \n– In the metastatic setting, or  \n– In the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and have developed disease recurrence during or within six \nmonths of completing therapy  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen  \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY  \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure  to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \nContraindications  \nNone. \n \nWarnings and Precautions \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 491 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 13% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis \noccurred in 1.4% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 5.5 months (range: 1.1 \nto 20.8).\n7 Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to \nfirst onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2  to 21.0). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Monitor \ncomplete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. \nFor Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC < 1.0 x \n109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 491 patients with unresectable or metastatic HE R2-positive breast cancer who \nreceived ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 68% of patients. Eighteen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 22 days (range: 6 to 664). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.2% of patients. \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with EN HERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% \nof patients. Fifty-one percent had Grade 3 or  4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of \npatients.  \n Left Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, in cluding \nENHERTU. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. When LVEF is >45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue tr eatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and \nabsolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment \nwithin 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40- 45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt \nENHERTU and repea t LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from \nbaseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume \ntreatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease f rom baseline is \n>20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic conges tive heart failure. Treatment with ENHERTU \nhas not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn the 491 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU 5.4 \nmg/kg, 13 cases (2.6%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported.   \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU  6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were \nreported; however, on echocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF.\n8 Embryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \nat least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 month s after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nThe pooled safety population for patients with metastatic breast cancer reflects exposure t o ENHERTU at 5.4 \nmg/kg given as an intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks (21-day cycle) in 491 patients in DESTINY-Breast03, DESTINY -Breast01, and Study DS8201-A-J101. The median duration of treatment was 13 months \n(range: 0.7 to 37). In this pooled safe ty population, the most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including \nlaboratory abnormalities, were nausea (78%), decreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased hemoglobin \n(68%), decreased neutrophil count (68%), increased aspartate aminotransferase  (58%), fatigue  (57%), \ndecreased lymphocyte count (56%), vomiting  (50%), decreased platelet count (49%), increased alanine \naminotransferase (48%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase  (45%), alopecia  (41%), constipation (35%), \nhypokalemia (33%), decreased appeti te (32%), diarrhea (31%), musculoskeletal pain  (28%), increased \ntransaminases (27%), respiratory infection  (24%), headache (21%), and abdominal pain (21%).  \n \nDESTINY-Breast03 The safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 257 patients with unresectable or metastati c HER2 -positive breast \ncancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY- Breast03. ENHERTU was \nadministered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 14 \nmonths (range: 0.7 to 30).  \n Serious adverse reactions occurred in 19% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were vomiting, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, pyrexia, and \nurinary tract infection. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients including COVID-19 \nand sudden death (one patient each). \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 14% of patients, of which ILD/pneumonitis accounted for 8%. \nDose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, pneumonia, nausea, fatigue, and ILD/pneumonitis. Dose reductions occurred in 21% of \npatients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction \nwere nausea, neutropenia, and fatigue. \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (76%), decreased white blood cell count  (74%), decreased neutrophil count (70%), increased aspartate \naminotransferase (67%), decreased hemoglobin (64%), decreased lymphocyte count (55%), increased alanine aminotransferase (53%), decreased platelet count (52%), fatigue (49%), vomiting (49%), increased blood \nalkaline phosphatase (49%), alopecia (37%), hypokalemia (35%), constipation (34%), musculoskeletal pain (31%), diarrhea (29%), decreased appetite (29%), respiratory infection (22%), headache (22%), abdominal pain \n(21%), increased blood bilirubin (20%), and stomatitis (20%).\n9 Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in DESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly \nor paclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5  to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \n Serious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased app etite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred in one patient each (0.8%).  \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) asso ciated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were dec reased hemoglobin \n(75%), decreased white blood cell count (74%), decreased neutrophil count (72%), decreased lymphocyte count \n(70%), decreased platelet count (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), increased aspartate \naminotransferase (58%), fatigue (55%), increased blood alkaline phosphatase (54%), increased alanine \naminotransferase (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), increased blood bilirubin (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%). \n Use in Specific Popula tions  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the l ast dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contracep tion: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use \neffective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. \nMales : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception \nduring treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU \nmay impair male reproductive function and fertility. \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. \n• Geriatric Use: Of  the 491 patients with HER2- positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \n22% were ≥65 years and 4% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy within clinical studies were \nobserved between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger pati ents. There was a higher incidence of \nGrade 3 -4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (60%) as compared to younger patients \n(49%). Of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ \nadenocarcinoma treated w ith ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% \nwere ≥75  years. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of \nage compared to younger patients.\n10 • Renal Impairment:  A higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 ILD/pneumonitis has been observed in patients \nwith moderate renal impairment. Monitor patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosel y monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout  Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our world-class science and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the  \nworld.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular disease, Daiichi Sankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as well as other diseases with high unmet medical needs.

    "content": "Press Release  \n \nENHERTU® Granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in U.S. for \nPatients with HER2 Low Metastatic Breast Cancer  \n \n• Based on DESTINY -Breast04  results  where  Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s ENHERTU \ndemonstrated significant improvement in both  progression- free survival and overall  survival  \n• ENHERTU has now been granted five Breakthrough Therapy Designations, including three in breast \ncancer  and one in both lung and gastric cancers  \n \nTokyo and Basking Ridge, NJ – ( April 26 , 2022) – Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and AstraZeneca’s \n(LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) ENHERTU® (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki) has been granted Breakthrough \nTherapy Designation (BTD) in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic \nHER2 low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -negative) breast cancer  who have received a prior systemic therapy in the \nmetastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant \nchemotherapy. Patients with hormone receptor (HR) positive breast cancer should additionally have received \nor be ineligible for endocrine therapy.  \n \nENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly \ndeveloped and commercialized  by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca. \n \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) BTD is designed to accelerate the development and \nregulatory revi ew of potential new medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition and address a \nsignificant unmet medical need. The new medicine needs to have shown encouraging preliminary clinical results that demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinicall y significant endpoint over available \nmedicines.  \n \nThe FDA granted the BTD based on data  from the pivotal DESTINY -Breast04  phase 3 trial where \nENHERTU demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in both \nprogression- free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with HER2 low unresectable and/or \nmetastatic breast cancer with HR pos itive or HR negative disease versus physician’s choice of chemotherapy, \nwhich is the current standard of care.\n The positive topline results of DESTINY -Breast04 were recently  \nannounced and these data will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.  \n \nThe safety profile of ENHERTU was consistent with previous clinical trials with no new safety concerns identified . Overall interstitial lung disease (ILD) rates were consistent with that observed in late-line HER2\n2 \n positive breast cancer trials of ENHERTU with a lower rate of grade 5 ILD observed, as determined by an \nindependent adjudication committee.  “Historically, only patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer were shown to benefit from HER2 directed therapy. DESTINY- Breast04, in which ENHERTU showed a clinically meaningful survival benefit \nin patients with HER2 low metastatic breast cancer, is the first trial to demonstrate that selecting patients for treatment based on low expression of HER2 has the potential to change the diagnostic and treatment \nparadigms for these patients, ” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “ This \nBreakthrough Therapy Designation acknowledges the potential of ENHERTU  to fulfill an unmet medical \nneed  and w e look forward to working closely with the FDA to bring the first HER2 directed therapy to \npatients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors have lower levels of HER2 expression.”  \n “Today’s news is a significant validation of the potential we see for the historic DESTINY -Breast04 trial to \nenable a paradigm shift in how breast cancer is classified by target ing the full spectrum of HER2 \nexpression,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “ENHERTU continues to show transformative potential, and this milestone  represent s an important advance \nfor patients with HER2 low metastatic breast cancer who are in urgent need of new treatment options and better outcomes .”  \n This i s the third BTD for ENHERTU in breast cancer. ENHERTU previously received BTDs for  the \ntreatment of  second- line HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer in 2021 and late r-line HER2 positive \nmetastatic breast cancer in 2017 . Two additional BTDs for ENHERTU also have been  granted in 2020 for \nHER2  mutant metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer . \n \nAbout DESTINY- Breast04   \nDESTINY -Breast04 is a global, randomized, open- label, pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and \nsafety of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) versus physician’s choice of chemo therapy (capecitabine, eribulin, \ngemcitabine, paclitaxel or nab -paclitaxel) in patients with HR positive (n=480) or HR negative (n=60), \nunresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer with low HER2 expression previously treated with one or two \nprior lines of chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either ENHERTU or chemotherapy.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY- Breast0 4 is PFS in  patients with  HR positive disease  based on blinded \nindependent central review (BICR). Key secondary endpoints include PFS based on BICR in all randomized \npatients (HR positive and HR negative disease), OS in patients with HR positive disease and OS in all \nrandomized patients (HR positive and HR negative disease ). Other secondary endpoints include PFS based\n3 \n on investigator assessment, objective response rate based on BICR and on investigator assessment, duration \nof response based on BICR and safety.   DESTINY -Breast0 4 enrolled approx imately 540  patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and North \nAmerica . For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Breast Cancer  and HER2 E xpression  \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths worldwide \nand in the U.S.1,2 More than two million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020, resulting in nearly \n685,000 deaths globally.1 In the U.S., more than 290,000 new cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2022, \nresulting in more than 43,000 deaths.3 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers, and is one of many biomarkers expressed in \nbreast cancer tumors.4  \n \nHER2 expression is currently defined as either positive or negative, and is determined by an IHC test which \nmeasures the amount of HER2 protein on a cancer cell, and/or an ISH test, which counts the copies of the \nHER2  gene in cancer cells.4,5 HER2 positive cancers are defined as IHC 3+, IHC 2+/ISH+.4 HER2 negative \ncancers are currently defined as IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-.4 Up to half  of all patients with breast cancer \nhave tumors with a HER2 IHC score of 1+, or a HER2 IHC score of 2+ in combination with a negative ISH \ntest, an expression level not currently eligible for HER2 targeted therapy.6,7,8,9 Low HER2 expression occurs \nin both HR positive and HR negative disease.10 \n HER2 testing is routinely used  to determine appropriate treatment options for patients with metastatic breast \ncancer. Targeting the lower range of expression in the HER2 spectrum may offer another approach to delay \ndisease progression and extend survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer.\n11 Currently, chemotherapy \nremains the only treatment option both for patients with HR positive tumors following progression on endocrine (hormone) therapy.\n12 Few targeted options are available for those who are HR negative.13  \n About ENHERTU ENHERTU\n® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 \ndirected ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced pr ogram in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific platform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide- based cleavable linker.\n4 \n ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in m ore than 40 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2  \nbased regimens based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial. \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.  \n ENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see the accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication Guide . \n About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program A com prehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n  \nRegulatory applications for ENHERTU are currently under review in Europe , Japan , U.S . and several other \ncountries for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who \nhave received a prior anti- HER2 -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY- Breast03  trial. \n \nENHERTU also is currently under review in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or \nmetastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a HER2 (ERBB2 ) mutation  and who have received a prior systemic \ntherapy based on the results from the DESTINY -Lung01 trial, and in Europe  for the treatment of adult \npatients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior anti -HER 2 based regimen based on the DESTINY -Gastric01  and DESTINY -Gastric02  trials . \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (referred to as Daiichi Sankyo) and AstraZeneca entered into a global \ncollaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan \n(Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. \nDaiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.\n5 \n U.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens in the metastatic setting.  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory t rial. \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen.  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY  \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor pa tients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue f or at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis \noccurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3). \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to \nfirst onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2  to 21.0).\n6 \n  \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU.  \nMonitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically \nindicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x \n109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile \nneutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than \n1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level. \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic H ER2-positive breast cancer who \nreceived ENHERTU 5.4mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 62% of patients. Sixteen \npercent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil \ncount was 23 days (range: 6 to 547). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients. \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENH ERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% \nof patients. Fifty-one percent had Grade 3 or  4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of \npatients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, inc luding \nENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2- positive breast cancer who received \nENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY -Gastric01, of \nthe 125 patients with locally advanced or metastati c HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with \nENHERTU has n ot been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF \n<50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically \nindicated. When LVEF is  >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10- 20%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolu te decrease \nfrom baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not \nrecovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with EN HERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. \nPermanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure. \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \nat least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male pat ients with female partners of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 \nmonths after the last dose of ENHERTU.\n7 \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (plat elets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic \nHER2 -positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY- Breast01  \nand Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. \nThe median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, \ncellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of \npatients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each \n(0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounte d for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions \noccurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia. \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse react ions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (79%), white \nblood cell count decreased (70%), hemoglobin decreased (70%), neutrophil count decreased (62%), fatigue \n(59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (41%), al anine aminotransferase \nincreased (38%), platelet count decreased (37%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), diarrhea (29%), hypokalemia (26%), and cough (20%). \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was  evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in DESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly \nor paclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5  to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fataliti es due to adverse reactions occurred in \n2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred in one patient each (0.8%).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD account ed for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia , decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decreased \n(75%), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (72%), lymphocyte count decreased\n8 \n (70%), platelet count decreased (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), anemia (58%), aspartate \naminotransferase increased (58%), fatigue (55%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (54%), alanine \naminotransferase increased (47% ), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), \nblood bilirubin increased (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \nUse in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the l ast dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contracep tion: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. \nMales : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception \nduring treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU \nmay impair male reproductive function and fertility. \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2- positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \n26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall dif ferences in efficacy were observed between \npatients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3- 4 adverse \nreactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Of the \n125 patie nts with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥ 75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to \nyounger patients.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA-1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n \nPlease see accompanying full Pres cribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout  Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our world-\nclass science and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the \nworld.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular disease, Daiichi \nSankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as well as other diseases \nwith high unmet medical needs.

    "content": "Press Release  \nENHERTU® Granted Priority Review in the U.S. for Patients with \nPreviously Treated HER2  Mutant Metastatic Non -Small Cell Lung \nCancer    \n• Based on pivotal DESTINY-Lung01 results showing Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s ENHERTU \ndemonstrat ed a 54.9% tumor response rate \n• If approved, ENHERTU to  provide patients with a much -needed targeted therapy option \n \nTokyo and Basking Ridge, NJ – ( April  19, 2022)  – Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and AstraZeneca \n(LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN)  have received notification of acceptance of the supplemental Biologics License \nApplication (sBLA) of  ENHERTU® (fam- trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki) for the treatment of adult patients in \nthe U.S. with unresectable or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a HER2 \n(ERBB2 ) mutation and who have received a prior systemic therapy . The application has also been granted \nPriority Review.   \n \nENHERTU is  a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly developed by Daiichi Sankyo \nand AstraZeneca. \n \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) grants Priority Review to applications for medicines that, if \napproved, would offer significant improvements over available options by demonstrating safety or efficacy improvements, preventing serious conditions or enhancing patient compliance. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date, the FDA action date for their regulatory decision, is during the third quarter of the \n2022 calendar year. The Priority Review follows receipt of Breakthrough Therapy Designation, granted  by \nthe FDA in May 2020 for ENHERTU in  this cancer type.  \n Lung cancer is the second most common form of cancer globally, with more than two million new cases \ndiagnosed in 2020.\n1  For  patients with metastatic NSCLC , prognosis is particularly poor, as only \napproximately 8% will live beyond five years after diagnosis.2 There are currently no HER2 directed \ntherapies approved specifically for the treatment of HER 2 mutant NSCLC, which occurs in approximately \n2% to 4% of patients with non-squamous NSCLC.3,4 \n \n“The results of DESTINY -Lung- 01 showed that ENHERTU is the first HER2 directed therapy to \ndemonstrate a strong and robust tumor response  in more than half of patients with previously treated HER2\n2 \n mutant metastatic non -small cell lung cancer, ” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. \n“Seeking approval in the U.S. for a third  tumor type  in three years further demonstrates the significant \npotential of  ENHERTU  in treating multiple HER2 targetable cancers .”  \n \n“The DESTINY -Lung01 trial confirmed the HER2  mutation as an actionable biomarker in non- small cell \nlung cancer,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, \nAstraZeneca. “I f approved, ENHERTU has the potential to become a new standard treatment  in this patient \npopulation, offe ring a much -needed  option for patients with HER2 mutant metastatic non -small cell lung \ncancer who currently have no targeted treatment  options .”  \n The sBLA is based on data from the pivotal DESTINY -Lung01 phase 2 trial published in The New England \nJournal of Medicine , and is supported by the phase 1 trial (DS8201-A-J101) published in Cancer Discovery. \n Primary results from the HER2  mutant cohort (cohort 2) of DESTINY -Lung01 in previously- treated HER 2 \nmutant NSCLC demonstrated a confirmed objective response rate (ORR) of 54.9% (n=50; 95% confidence \ninterval [ CI]: 44.2-65.4) in patients  treated with  ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) as assessed by independent central \nreview (ICR) . Out of a total of 91 patients, one (1.1%) complete response (CR) and 49 (53.8%) partial \nresponses (PR) were observed. A confirmed disease control rate (DCR) of 92.3% (95% CI: 84.8-96.9) was seen with a redu ction in tumor size observed in most patients. After a median follow -up of 13.1 months, the \nmedian duration of response (DoR) for ENHERTU was 9.3 months (95% CI: 5.7-14.7). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.2 months (95% CI: 6.0-11.9) and the median overall survival (OS) was \n17.8 months (95% CI: 13.8-22.1).   \nThe safety profile of the most common adverse events with ENHERTU in DESTINY-Lung01 was consistent \nwith previous clinical trials. The most common grade 3 or higher drug -related treatment- emergent adverse \nevents were neutropenia (18.7%), anemia (9.9%), nausea (8.8%), fatigue (6.6%), leukopenia (4.4%), diarrhea (3.3%) and vomiting (3.3%). Twenty -three patients (25%) discontinued treatment due to drug- related \ntreatment -emergent adverse event s. Overall, 26 % of patients had interstitial lung disease (ILD) or \npneumonitis related to treatment as determined by an independent adjudication committee. The majority of ILD events (75%) were low grade (grade 1 (12.5%) or grade 2 (62.5%)). Out of the total study population, \nfour grade 3 ( 4.4%) and two grade 5 (2.2%) ILD or pneumonitis events were reported.   \n \nAbout DESTINY- Lung01  \nDESTINY -Lung01 is  a global phase 2, open- label, two -cohort trial evaluating the efficacy and safety  of \nENHERTU in patients with HER2  mutant (6.4  mg/kg) or HER2 overexpressing (defined as IHC3+ or\n3 \n IHC2+ ) [6.4 mg/kg and 5.4 mg/kg] unresectable and/or metastatic non -squamous NSCLC who had \nprogressed after one or more systemic therapies. The primary endpoint is confirmed ORR by ICR. Key \nsecondary endpoints include DoR, DCR, PFS, OS and safety. DESTINY- Lung01 enrolled approximately \n180 patients at multiple sites, including Asia, Europe and North America. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov .  \n \nAbout  HER2  Mutant  NSCLC            \nLung cancer is the second most common form of cancer globally, with more than two million new cases diagnosed in 2020.\n1 In the U.S ., lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer, with  more than  \n236,000 new cases expected in 2022.5 For patients with metastatic NSCLC , prognos is is particularly poor, as \nonly approximately 8% will live beyond five years after diagnosis.2 \n HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors, including lung, breast, gastric and colorectal cancers. Certain HER2 gene alterations (called HER2  \nmutations) have been identified in NSCLC as dis tinct molecular targets and have been reported in \napproximately 2% to 4% of patients with non-squamous NSCLC.\n3,4 While HER2 gene mutations can occur \nin a range of patients, they are more commonly found in patients with NSCLC who are younger, female and have never smoked.\n6 HER2 gene mutations have been independently associated with cancer cell growth and \npoor prognosis, with an increased incidence of brain metastases.7 Although the role of anti -HER2 treatment \nis well established in breast and gastric cancers, HER2 is an emerging biomarker in NSCLC with no approved HER2 directed therapies .\n3,8 Next-generation sequencing has been utilized in the identification of  \nHER2  (ERBB2 ) mutations .9 \n \nAbout ENHERTU \nENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2  \ndirected ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.  ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide- based cleavable linker.  \n ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in mor e than 40 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.\n4 \n ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in several countries f or the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.   \n \nENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see the accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide .  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program A comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n \nRegulatory applications for ENHERTU are currently under review in Europe , Japan , U.S . and several other \ncountries for the treatment of adult  patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who \nhave received a prior anti- HER2 -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY- Breast03  trial. \n \nENHERTU also is currently under review in Europe  for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced \nor metastatic HER2 positive gastric or GEJ adenocarci noma who have received a prior anti-HER2 based \nregimen based on the DESTINY -Gastric01  and DESTINY- Gastric02  trials.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration  \nDaiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (referred to as Daiichi Sankyo) and AstraZeneca entered into a global \ncollaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan \n(Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. \nDaiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.  U.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens in the metastatic setting.\n5 \n This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this i ndication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen .  \n \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY  \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \nWarnings and Precautions \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor pa tients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue f or at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis \noccurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3). \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to \nfirst onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2  to 21.0). \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile n eutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU.  \nMonitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 10\n9/L) interrupt\n6 \n ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x \n109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile \nneutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature  >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than \n1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level. \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who \nreceived ENHERTU 5.4mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 62% of patients. Sixteen \npercent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil \ncount was 23 days (range: 6 to 547). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients. \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease i n neutrophil count was reported in 72% \nof patients. Fifty-one percent had Grade 3 or  4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of \npatients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2- positive breast cancer who received \nENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY -Gastric01, of \nthe 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric  or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with \nENHERTU has not been studied in pati ents with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF \n<50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically \nindicated. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decr ease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease \nfrom baseli ne is 10 -20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not \nrecovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose.  When LVEF is <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue EN HERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure . \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \nat least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 \nmonths after the last dose of ENHERTU.\n7 \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) inte rrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic \nHER2 -positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY- Breast01  \nand Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. \nThe median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were intersti tial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, \ncellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patie nt each \n(0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and \nhemorrhagic shock.  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions \noccurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia. \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (79%), white blood cell count decreased (70%), hemoglobin decreased (70%), neutrophil count decreased (62%), fatigue \n(59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (41%), alanine aminotransferase \nincreased (38%), platelet count decreased (37%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), \ndiarrhea (29%), hypokalemia (26%), and cough (20%). \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in DESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m\n2 biweekly \nor paclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5  to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \n Serious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, pneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reaction s occurred in \n2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred in one patient each (0.8%).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most\n8 \n frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fati gue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decreased \n(75%), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (72%), lymphocyte count decreased \n(70%) , platelet count decreased (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), anemia (58%), aspartate \naminotransferase increased (58%), fatigue (55%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (54%), alanine \naminotransferase increased (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), \nblood bilirubin increased (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%). \n \nUse in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential  risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a \nbreastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and  Males of Reproductive Potential: Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. \nMales : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception \nduring treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU \nmay impair male reproductive function and fertility. \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and ef fectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2- positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \n26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between \npatients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3- 4 adverse \nreactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \n To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA-1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n Please see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout  Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our world-\nclass science and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the world.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular disease, Daiichi \nSankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as well as other diseases\n9 \n with high unmet medical needs.

    "content": "Press Release  \n \nENHERTU® Significantly  Improved Both Progression- Free and \nOverall Survival in DESTINY -Breast04 Trial in Patients with  \nHER2 Low Metastatic Breast Cancer  \n \n• First HER2 low metastatic breast cancer phase 3 results for Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s \nENHERTU offer potential to redefine how the disease  is classified and treated   \n• Plans for global regulatory submissions are underway  \n \nTokyo, Munich and Basking Ridge, NJ –  (February 21 , 2022 ) – Positive topline results from the pivotal \nDESTINY -Breast04  phase 3 trial showed ENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan) demonstrated a statistically \nsignificant and clinically meaningful improvement in both  progression- free survival (PFS) and overall \nsurvival (OS) in patients with HER2 low unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer  regardless of hormone \nreceptor ( HR) status versus  physician’s choice of chemotherapy, which is  the current standard of care . \nENHERTU is  a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly developed by Daiichi Sankyo \nand AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) .  \n \nAll p atients in the trial received a HER2 test and the results were centrally confirmed. HER2 low status was \ndefined as  an immunohistochemistry (IHC) score of 1+ or IHC2+ with a negative in -situ hybridization (ISH) \nscore.   \n \nHER2 expression is currently defined as either positive  or negative.1 HER2 positive cancers are defined as \nIHC 3+  or IHC 2+/ISH+  and HER2  negative cancers are defined as IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH -.1 Up to \n55% of all patients  with breast  cancer have tumors with a HER2 IHC score of 1+ or a HER2 IHC score of 2+ \nin combination with a negative ISH test, an expression level  not currently eligible for HER2 targeted  \ntherapy.2,3 Low HER2  expression occurs in both hormone receptor (HR) positive and HR negative disease.4 \n \nHER2 testing is well- established  to determine an appropriate treatment strategy  in metastatic breast cancer. \nTargeting the  lower range of HER2 expression may offer a nother  approach to delay disease progression and \nextend survival  in patients  with metastatic breast cancer .5 Currently, chemotherapy remains the only \ntreatment option both for patients with HR positive tumors following progression on endocrine (hormone) \ntherapy and for those  who are HR negative.6   \n \nDESTINY -Breast04  met its primary endpoint  where ENHERTU demonstrated superior  PFS in previously -\ntreated patients with  HR positive , HER2 low metastatic breast cancer compared to the standard of care\n2 \n chemotherapy. The trial met the key secondary endpoint of PFS in patients with HER2 low metastatic breast \ncancer regardless of HR status ( HR positive or HR negative ). The trial also met other key secondary \nendpoints of  OS in patients with HR positive disease and patients regardless of HR status at interim analysis.  \n \nThe safety profile of ENHERTU was consistent with previous clinical trials with no new safety concerns \nidentified . Overall interstitial lung disease (ILD) rates were consistent with that observed in late -line HER2 \npositive breast cancer trials of ENHERTU with a lower rate of grade 5 ILD  observed, as determined by an \nindependent adjudication committee . \n “ENHERTU continues to redefine  the treatment of HER2 targetable cancers. DESTINY- Breast04  is the fir st \never phase 3 trial of a HER2 directed therapy in patients with HER2 low metastatic breast cancer  to show a \nstatistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in progression- free and overall  survival  compared to \nstandard treatment ,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D , Daiichi Sankyo. “ We look forward to \nsharing the detailed findings of DESTINY -Breast04 with the medical community and initiating discussions \nwith regulatory agencies globally with the goal of  potentially  bringing ENHERTU to patients with metastatic \nbreast cancer previously considered to be  HER2 negative .”  \n \n“Today’s historic news from DESTINY -Breast04 could reshape how breast cancer is classified and treated ,” \nsaid Susan Galbraith, MBBChir , PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “ A HER2 \ndirected therapy has never before shown a benefit  in patients with HER2 low metastatic breast  cancer . These \nresults for ENHERTU are a huge step forward  and could potentially expand our abi lity to target the full \nspectrum of HER2 expression, validat ing the need to change  the way we categorize and treat breast cancer .”  \n \nThe data will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and shared with global  health authorities.  \n \nAbout DESTINY- Breast0 4  \nDESTINY -Breast0 4 is a global, randomized, open- label , pivotal  phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy  and \nsafety  of ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) versus physician’s choice of chemo therapy (capecitabine, eribulin, \ngemcitabine, paclitaxel  or nab -paclitaxel ) in patients with  HR positive (n=480) or HR negative (n=60) , \nHER2 low unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with one or two prior lines of  \nchemotherapy. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either ENHERTU or chemotherapy.  \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY -Breast0 4 is PFS in  patients with  HR positive disease\n based on blinded \nindependent central review (BICR) . Key s econdary endpoints include PFS based on BICR  in all randomized \npatients (regardless of  HR status) , OS in patients with  HR positive disease and OS  in all randomized patients\n3 \n (regardless of HR status) . Other secondary endpoints include  PFS based on  investigator assessment , \nobjective response rate based on BICR and on investigat or assessment , duration of response  based on BICR \nand safety.  \n \nDESTINY -Breast0 4 enrolled approx imately 54 0 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe  and North \nAmerica . For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout Breast Cancer and HER2 E xpression  \nBreast cancer i s the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide .7 More than two million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020 resulting in nearly \n685,000 deaths  globally.7 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers , and is one of many biomarkers expressed in \nbreast cancer tumors .1 HER2 expression is currently defined as either positive or negative, and is determined \nby an IHC test which measures the amount of HER2 protein in a cancer cell, and/or an ISH test, which \ncounts the copies of the HER2 gene in cancer cells. 1,8 HER2 positive cancers are defined as IHC 3+ , IHC \n2+/ISH+  and HER2 negative  cancers are currently defined as IHC 0 , IHC 1+  or IHC 2+/ISH -.1 Up to 55% of \nall patients with breast cancer have tumors with a HER2 IHC score of 1+, or a HER2 IHC score of 2+ in \ncombination with a negative ISH test, an expression level not currently eligible for HER2 targeted therapy.2,3 \nLow HER 2 expression occurs  in both hormone receptor (HR) positive and HR negative disease.4  \n HER2 testing is well- established  to determine an appropriate treatment strategy  in metastatic breast cancer.  \nTargeting the  lower range of HER2 expression may offer another approach to delay disease progression and \nextend survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer.\n5 Currently, chemotherapy remains the only \ntreatment option both for patients with HR positive tumors following p rogression on endocrine (hormone) \ntherapy and for those  who are HR negative.6 \n About ENHERTU \nENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2  \ndirected ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific platform.  ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payload, an exate can derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide- based cleavable linker .\n4 \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is  approved in more than 40 countries  for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 \nbased regimens based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in several countries f or the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma  who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the  DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.   \n \nENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see the accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide .  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Progra m \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combination with other anti cancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n \nRegulatory applications for ENHERTU are currently under review in Europe , Japan , US and several other \ncountries for the  treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who \nhave received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen  based on the results from the DESTINY- Breast03  trial.  \nENHERTU also  is currently under review in Europe  for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced \nor metastatic HER2 positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who have received a prior anti -HER2 bas ed \nregimen  based on the DESTINY -Gastric01  and DESTINY- Gastric02  trials.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (referred to as Daiichi Sankyo)  and AstraZeneca entered into a global \ncollaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan \n(Dato -DXd)  in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. \nDaiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nU.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive b reast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens in the metastatic setting.\n5 \n This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen.  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for ef fective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise  patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one le vel. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticostero id treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with u nresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis \noccurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 \nto 8.3).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. M edian time to \nfirst onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2  to 21.0).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU.  Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically \nindicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil C ount [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 10\n9/L) interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x \n109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile \nneutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than \n1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.\n6 \n  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic H ER2-positive breast cancer who \nreceived ENHERTU 5.4mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 62% of patients. Sixteen \npercent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil \ncount was 23 days (r ange: 6 to 547). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% \nof patients. Fifty- one percent had Grade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia wa s reported in 4.8% of \npatients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2- positive breast cancer who received \nENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY -Gastric01, of \nthe 125 patients with locally advanced or metast atic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with \nENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significan t cardiac disease or LVEF \n<50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically \nindicated. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10- 20%, continue treat ment with \nENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease \nfrom baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat L VEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not \nrecovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute \ndecrease from  baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF \nof <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. \nPermanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \nat least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 \nmonths after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then mai ntain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic \nHER2 -positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Breast01\n7 \n and Study DS8201- A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. \nThe median durati on of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, \ncellu litis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of \npatients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each \n(0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and \nhemorrhagic shock.  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHE RTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions \noccurred in 18% of patients treated with E NHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (79%), white blood cell count decreased (70%) , hemoglobin decreased (70%), neutrophil count decreased (62%), fatigue \n(59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (41%), alanine aminotransferase increased (38%), platelet count decreased (37%), constipation (35%), decreas ed appetite (32%), anemia (31%), \ndiarrhea (29%), hypokalemia (26%), and cough (20%).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2- positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma  in DESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly \nor paclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median dur ation of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5  to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \n Serious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreaction s in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in \n2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagul ation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred \nin one patient each (0.8%).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adv erse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decreased \n(75%), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (72%), lymphocyte count decreased \n(70%), platelet count decreased (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetit e (60%), anemia (58%), aspartate \naminotransferase increased (58%), fatigue (55%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (54%), alanine aminotransferase increased (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), \nblood bilirubin i ncreased (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).\n8 \n Use in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHER TU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a \nbreastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contracepti on during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. \nMales : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception \nduring treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU \nmay impair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2- positive breast cancer  treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \n26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between \npatients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3- 4 adverse \nreactions observed  in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Of the \n125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% wer e ≥75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to \nyounger patients.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monito r for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout  Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our world-\nclass science and technology for our purpose  “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the \nworld.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular disease, Daiichi \nSankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as wel l as other diseases \nwith high unmet medical needs.

    "content": "1 \n \n \nPress Release  \nENHERTU® Granted Priority Review in the U.S. for Patients with \nHER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer Treated with  a Prior  \nAnti -HER2 -Based Regimen  \n \n• Based on groundbreaking DESTINY -Breast03 results show ing Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s \nENHERTU reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 72% versus  ado- trastuzumab emtansine \n(T-DM1)  \n• Application being evaluated under FDA Real -Time Oncology Review and Project Orbis  \n \nTokyo, Munich  and Basking Ridge, NJ  – (January 17, 2022 ) – Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited \n(hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) and AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) have received notification of \nacceptance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) of the supplemental Biologics License \nApplica tion (sBLA) of ENHERTU® (fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki)  for the treatment of adult patients in \nthe U.S. with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received a prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimen . The applicatio n has also  been granted Priority Review .  \n ENHERTU is a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly developed by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca.  \n \nThe FDA grants Priority Review to applications for medicines that , if approved, would offer significant \nimprovements over available options by demonstrating safety or efficacy improvements, preventing serious \nconditions, or enhancing patient compliance. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act date (PDUFA) , the FDA \naction date for their regulatory decision , is during the second quarter of  the 2022 calendar year . \n \nThe sBLA is being reviewed under  the Real -Time Oncology Review (RTOR) program and Project Orbis, \ntwo initiatives of the FDA which are designed to bring effective cancer treatments to patients as early as \npossible. RTOR allows  the FDA to review  components of an  application before submissi on of the complete  \napplication. Project Orbis provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology \nmedicines among participating international partners . \n \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, with more than two million cases diagnosed in 2020, \nresulting in nearly 685,000 deaths globally.\n1 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered\n2 \n HER2 positive.2 Despite initial treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane, patients with HER2  positive \nmetastatic breast cancer will often experience disease progression.3 More treatment  options are  needed to \nfurther delay progression and extend survival .3,4,5 \n \n“This re gulatory review of ENHERTU in the U.S. marks the first time this medicine is participating in both \nthe Real -Time Oncology Review and Project Orbis programs ,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, \nDaiichi Sankyo. “The FDA’s prioritization of our application underscores the potential  of this medicine and \nthe continued need to expedite the availability of new treatment options , while making it possible  to \npotentially receive approvals in several countries concurren tly.” \n “This review across geographies  and the priority review in the U .S. as part of Project Orbis is so important \nbecause it speaks to the transformative potential  of ENHERTU based on the unprecedented progression- free \nsurvival benefit in this setting ,” said Susan Galbraith , Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D , \nAstraZeneca. “ The news  reinforces the importance of bringing this potential new option  to patients as \nquickly as possible.”  \n The sBLA is based on data from the  pivotal  DESTINY -Breast03  phase 3 trial that w ere presented at  the 2021 \nEuropean Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress . In the trial, ENHERTU demonstrated a 72% \nreduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared to T -DM1 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28; 95% \nconfidence interval [ CI]: 0.22- 0.37; p=7.8x10\n-22) in patients with HER2 positive unresectable and/or \nmetastatic breast cancer  previously treated wi th trastuzumab and a taxane. The median progression -free \nsurvival ( PFS) for patients treated with ENHERTU was not reached (95% CI: 18.5- NE) compared to 6.8 \nmonths for T -DM1 (95% CI: 5.6- 8.2) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR).  In the \nsecondary endpoint analysis of PFS assessed by investigators, patients treated with ENHERTU experienced an improvement in PFS of 25.1 months (95% CI: 22.1 -NE) compared to 7.2 months (95% CI: 6.8- 8.3) for  \nT-DM1 (HR=0.26; 95% CI: 0.20- 0.35). There was a strong trend towards improved overall survival (OS) \nwith ENHERTU ( HR=0.56;  95% CI: 0.36- 0.86; p=0.007172), however, this analysis is not yet mature and is \nnot statistically significant. N early all patients treated with ENHERTU during the trial were alive at one year \n(94.1%; 95% CI: 90.3- 96.4) compared to 85.9% of patients treate d with T -DM1 (95% CI: 80.9- 89.7). \nConfirmed objective response rate (ORR) was more than doubled in the ENHERTU arm versus the T -DM1 \narm (79.7%; n=208; 95% CI: 74.3- 84.4) versus 34.2% (n=90; 95% CI: 28.5- 40.3; p<0.0001).  \n \nThe safety profile of the most common adverse events with ENHERTU in DESTINY -Breast03 was \nconsistent with previous clinical trials with no new safety concerns identified. The most common grade 3 or \nhigher drug- related treatment emergent adverse events in t he ENHERTU arm were neutropenia (19.1%), \nthrombocytopenia (7.0%), leukopenia (6.6%), nausea (6.6%), anemia (5.8%), fatigue (5.1%), vomiting\n3 \n (1.6%), increase in ALT (1.6%), decreased appetite (1.2%), increase in AST (0.8%), diarrhea (0.4%) and \nalopecia (0.4%). Overall, 10.5% of patients had interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis related to treatment as determined by an independent adjudication committee. The majority of ILD events (9.7%) were low grade (grade 1 (2.7%) or grade 2 (7.0%) ) with two grad e 3 (0.8%) events reported. No grade 4 or grade 5 \nILD or pneumonitis events occurred.  \n \nIn September 2021, ENHERTU received its fourth Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) in the U.S . for \nthe treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2  positive breast cancer who have \nreceiv ed one or more prior anti -HER2 -based regimen s.  \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is  the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide .1 More than two million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020 , resulting in nearly \n685,000 deaths globally.1 Approximately one in five cases of breast cance r are considered HER2 positive .2  \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers .6 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a \nresult of HER2 gene amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in \nbreast cancer .7 \n \nDespite initial treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane, patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer \nwill often experience disease progression .3 More treatment options are needed to further delay progression \nand extend survival .3,4,5 \n About DESTINY- Breast03   \nDESTINY -Breast03  is a global, head -to-head, randomized, open- label , pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating  the \nefficacy  and safety  of ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg ) versus T -DM1 in patients with HER2 positive unresectable \nand/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and  a taxane. The primary efficacy \nendpoint of DESTINY -Breast03 is PFS based on bli nded independent central review. Secondary efficacy \nendpoints include overall survival , ORR , duration of response , PFS based on investigator assessment  and \nsafety . DESTINY -Breast03 enrolled 524 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe , North America, Oce ania \nand South America . For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n About ENHERTU \nENHERTU\n® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 \ndirected ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is the lead\n4 \n ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced pr ogram in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific platform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n A supplemental New Drug Application in Japan is under review for the treatment of adult patients in Japan \nwith HER2 positive unresectable or recurrent breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane. \nAdditionally, a Type II Variation is currently under review by the European M edicines Agency (EMA) for \nthe treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have \nreceived one or more prior anti -HER2 -based regimen s. Both submissions are based on the results from the \nDESTINY -Breast03 trial.  \n ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2  \nbased regimens based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction  (GEJ)  adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.  \n A Type II Variation is currently under review by the EMA  for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who have received a prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimen . \n \nENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see the accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide . \n About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA com prehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2  targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n \nENHERTU was highlighted in the  Clinical Cancer Advances 2021  report as one of two significant  \nadvancements in the “ASCO Clinical Advance of the Year: Molecular Profiling Driving Progress in GI \nCancers,” based on data from both the DESTINY -Gastric01  and DESTINY -CRC01  trials, as well as one of\n5 \n the targeted therapy advances of the year in NSCLC bas ed on the interim results of the HER2  mutated cohort \nof the  DESTINY -Lung01 trial.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the \nmanufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nU.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens in the metastatic setting.  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory t rial. \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen.  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n  \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advi se patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. C onsider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5\n6 \n mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticoste roid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis \noccurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 \nto 8.3).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to \nfirst onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2  to 21.0).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU.  \nMonitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of E NHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically \nindicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x \n109/L) in terrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile \nneutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than \n1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one l evel.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who \nreceived ENHERTU 5.4mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 62% of patients. Sixteen \npercent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil \ncount was 23 days (range: 6 to 547). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% \nof patients. Fifty- one percent had Grade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of \npatients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2- positive breast cancer who received  \nENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic  LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY -Gastric01, of \nthe 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with \nENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically \nindicated. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10- 20%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from b aseline is <10%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease \nfrom baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not\n7 \n recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within \n10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment wit hin 3 weeks. If LVEF \nof <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. \nPermanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure . \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal h arm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective con traception during treatment and for \nat least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 \nmonths after the l ast dose of ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic \nHER2 -positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Breast01  \nand Study DS8201- A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. \nThe median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  \n Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, \ncellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due  to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of \npatients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each \n(0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and \nhemorrhagic shock.  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with  dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions \noccurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (79%), white \nblood cell count decreased (70%), hemoglobin decreased (70%), neutrophil count decreased (62%) , fatigue \n(59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (41%), alanine aminotransferase increased (38%), platelet count decreased (37%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), \ndiarrhea (29%), hypokalemia ( 26%), and cough (20%).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2- positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma  in DESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly \nor paclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) in the ENHERTU  group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5  to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.\n8 \n Serious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, IL D, anemia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred \nin one pat ient each (0.8%).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated wi th dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with EN HERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin d ecreased \n(75%), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (72%), lymphocyte count decreased (70%), platelet count decreased (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), anemia (58%), aspartate \naminotransferase increased (58%), fatigue (55%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (54%), alanine aminotransferase increased (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), \nblood bilirubin increased (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \n Use in Specific P opulations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 m onths following the last dose of ENHERTU. \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initia tion of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. \nMales : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception \nduring treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU \nmay impair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2- positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \n26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥ 75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between \npatients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3- 4 adverse \nreactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients  (42%). Of the \n125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥ 75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were ob served between patients ≥65 years of age compared to \nyounger patients.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor . \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n Please see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Me dication \nGuide .\n9 \n About  Daiichi Sankyo  \nDaiichi Sankyo is dedicated to creating new modalities and innovative medicines by leveraging our world-\nclass science and technology for our purpose “to contribute to the enrichment of quality of life around the \nworld.” In addition to our current portfolio of medicines for cancer and cardiovascular disease, Daiichi \nSankyo is primarily focused on developing novel therapies for people with cancer as well as other diseases \nwith high unmet medical needs.

    "content": "Press Release  \n \nTrastuzumab Deruxtecan Type II Variation Application Validated by \nEMA for Patients with HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer \nTreated with a Prior Anti -HER2 -Based Regimen  \n \n• Application b ased on DESTINY -Breast03 r esults showing Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s \ntrastuzumab deruxtecan  reduced risk of disease progression or death by 72% versus trastuzumab \nemtansine (T -DM1)   \n \nTokyo and Munich  – (December 28 , 2021)  – Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi \nSankyo) today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated the Type II Variation \napplication for trastuzumab deruxtecan for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic \nHER2 positive breast cancer who have received  one or more  prior anti -HER2 -based regimen s.  \n Trastuzumab deruxtecan  is a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC)  being jointly developed by \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) . \n Validation confirms that the application is complete and commences the scientific review process by the \nEMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP ). Th is app lication is based on data from \nthe DESTINY -Breast03  phase 3 trial presented  at the 2021 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) \nCongress .\n \n \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, with more than two million cases  diagnosed in 2020, \nresulting in nearly 685,000 deaths globally.1 In Europe, approximately 531,000 cases of breast cancer are \ndiagnosed annually.2 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.3 \nDespite initial treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane, patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer \nwill often experience disease progression.4 More treatment  options are needed to further delay progression \nand extend survival .4,5,6 \n “We are excited to have submitted a second  application  this year  seeking approval for trastuzumab \nderuxtecan for a potential third  indication  in Europe,”  said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice \nPresident, Global Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “With this specific \napplication, we look forward to working closely with the EMA to support the review of trastuzumab \nderuxtecan to be used in an earlier setting for  patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.”\n2 \n In DESTINY -Breast03 , trastuzumab deruxtecan  demonstrated a 72% reduction in the risk of disease \nprogression or death compared to trastuzumab emtansine ( T-DM1 ) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28; 95% \nconfidence interval [ CI]: 0.22- 0.37; p=7.8x10-22) in patients with HER2 positive unresectable and/or \nmetastatic breast cancer  previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane. The median progression -free \nsurvival (PFS)  for patients treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan  was not reached (95% CI: 18.5- NE) \ncompared to 6.8 months for T -DM1 (95% CI: 5.6- 8.2) as assessed by blinded independent central review \n(BICR). In the secondary endpoint analysis of PFS assessed by investigators, patients treated with \ntrastuzumab deruxtecan experienced a n improvement in PFS of 25.1 months (95% CI: 22.1- NE) compared to \n7.2 months (95% CI: 6.8- 8.3) for T -DM1 (HR=0.26; 95% CI: 0.20- 0.35). There was a strong trend towards \nimproved overall survival (OS) with trastuzumab deruxtecan (HR=0.56;  95% CI: 0.36- 0.86; p=0.007172), \nhowever this analysis is not yet mature and is not statistically significant. Nearly all patients treated with \ntrastuzumab deruxtecan  were alive at one year (94.1% ; 95% CI: 90.3- 96.4) compared to 85.9% of patients \ntreated with T -DM1  (95% CI: 80.9- 89.7) . Confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was more than doubled \nin the trastuzumab deruxtecan  arm versus the T -DM1 arm (79.7%  [n=208; 95% CI: 74.3- 84.4]  versus  34.2%  \n[n=90; 95% CI: 28.5- 40.3] ).  \n \nThe safety profile of the most common adverse events with trastuzumab deruxtecan  in DESTINY -Breast03 \nwas consistent with previous clinical trials with no new safety concerns identified. The most common grade 3 or higher drug- related treatment emergent adverse events in the trastuzumab deruxtecan  arm were \nneutropenia  (19.1%), thrombocytopenia (7.0%), leukopenia (6.6%), nausea (6.6%), anemia (5.8%), fatigue \n(5.1%), vomiting (1.6%), increase in ALT (1.6%), decreased appetite (1.2%), increase in AST (0.8%), diarrhea (0.4%) and alopecia (0.4%). Overall, 10.5% of patients had interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis related to treatment as determined by an independent adjudication committee. The majority of \nILD events (9.7%) were low grade (grade 1 (2.7%) or grade 2 (7.0%)) with two grade 3 (0.8%) events \nreported. No grade 4 or grade 5 ILD or pneumonitis events occurred.  \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is  the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.1 More than two million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020 , resulting in nearly \n685,000 deaths globally.1 In Europe, approximately 531,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually.2  \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth- promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers.7 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a \nresult of HER2  gene amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in \nbreast cancer.8 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.3\n3 \n Despite initial treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane, patients wi th HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer \nwill often experience disease progression.4 More treatment  options are needed to further delay progression \nand extend survival.4,5,6  \n \nAbout DESTINY- Breast03   \nDESTINY -Breast03  is a global, head -to-head, randomized, open- label , pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating  the \nefficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan  (5.4 mg/kg) versus T -DM1 in patients with HER2 positive \nunresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated w ith trastuzumab and a  taxane. The primary \nefficacy endpoint of DESTINY -Breast03 is PFS based on BICR. Secondary efficacy endpoints include OS , \nORR , duration of response , PFS based on investigator assessment  and safety . DESTINY- Breast03 enrolled \n524 patient s at multiple sites in Asia, Europe , North America, Oceania and South America . For more \ninformation about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n About Trastuzumab Deruxtecan  \nTrastuzumab deruxtecan ( fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed ADC. \nDesigned using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, trastuzumab deruxtecan is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most  advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific platform. Trastuzumab deruxtecan  consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a \ntopoisomerase I inhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n \nTrastuzum ab deruxtecan  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients \nwith unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -\nHER2 -based regimens based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n \nA supplemental New Drug Application is under review in Japan for the treatment of adult patients with \nHER2 positive unres ectable or recurrent breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane, \nbased on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n \nTrastuzumab deruxtecan  (6.4 mg/kg) is also approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the \nDESTINY -Gastric01  trial.  \n \nA Type II Variation is currently under review by the EMA  for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who have received a prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimen.\n4 \n  \nAbout the Trastuzumab Deruxtecan  Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab \nderuxtecan  monotherapy across multiple HER2  targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and \ncolorectal cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also \nunderway.  \n \nTrastuzumab deruxtecan  was highlighted in the  Clinical Cancer Advances 2021  report as one of two \nsignificant advancements in the “ASCO Clinical Advance of the Year: Molecular Profiling Driving Pr ogress \nin GI Cancers,” based on data from both the  DESTINY -Gastric01  and DESTINY -CRC01  trials, as well as \none of the targeted therapy advances of the year in NSCLC based on the interim results of the HER2  muta nt \ncohort of the  DESTINY -Lung01 trial.  \n Trastuzumab deruxtecan  recently received its fourth Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the U.S. for the \ntreatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received one or more prior anti -HER2 -based regimens.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize trastuzumab deruxtecan  in March 2019  and datopotamab  deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in \nJapan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of trastuzumab deruxtecan and datopotamab deruxtecan. \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo in Oncology  \nThe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo is powered by our team of world- class scientists that push beyond \ntraditional thinking to create transformative medicines for p eople with cancer.

The primary endpoint of \nDESTINY -Lung04 is progression -free survival  (PFS) as assessed by blinded independent central review  \n(BICR) . Secondary endpoints include overall survival,  investigator -assessed P FS, overall response rate  and \nduration of response  as assessed by BICR and investigator , pharmacokinetics, patient -reported tolerability, \nimmunogenicity  and safety . \n \nDESTINY -Lung04 will enroll approximately 264 patients at multiple sites across Asia, Europe, and North \nAmerica . For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout  HER2  Muta nt NSCLC            \nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death , account ing for about one -fifth of all cancer deaths globally, \nwith 80% to 85% classified as NSCLC .1,2,3 For patients with metastatic disease, prognosis is particularly \npoor, as only approximately 6% will live beyond five years after diagnosis .2  \n \nHER2 i s a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors, including lung, breast, gastric and colorectal cancers. HER2  gene alterations (called HER2 \nmutations) have been identified in NSCLC as distinct molecular targets and have been reported in \napproximately 2%  to 4%  of patients with  non-squamous  NSCLC.4,5 These HER2  gene mutations are \npredominantly seen in younger women, with no smoking history and have been independently associated \nwith cancer cell growth and poor prognosis, with an increased incidence of brain metastases.4,12,13,14,15,16 The \nmost common HER2 mutations are exon 20 insertions, found in 35% to 59% of all HER2  mutations in \nNSCLC , while exon 19 mutations represent approximately 16% of mutations . 17,18,19 Although the role of \nanti-HER2 treatment is well established in breast and gastric cancers, HER2 is an emerging biomarker in \nNSCLC with no approved HER2 directed therapies.4,20  \n Current standard of care in the first -line treatment of patients with HER2  mutant metastatic NSCLC is PD-1 \nor PD -L1 immunotherapy with or without platinum -based chemotherapy.\n6,7 While these treatment re gimens  \ncan impro ve survival in NSCLC, at least 40 % to 60% of tumors do not respond to  initial treatment and \ndisease progression occurs , underscoring the need for additional  treatment approaches.7,8,9,10,11\n3 \n About ENHERTU \nENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2  \ndirected antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC \ntechnology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced \nprogram in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.  ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody \nattached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide- based \ncleavable linker.  \n ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n A supplemental New Drug Application is under review in Japan for the treatment of adult patients with \nHER2 positive unresectable or recurrent breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane, \nbased on the results from the DESTINY -Breast03  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positi ve gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.  \n A Type II Variation is  currently under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment \nof adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen . \n \nENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see the accompanying full Presc ribing Information, including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide .  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2  targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combination with other anticancer tre atments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.\n4 \n ENHERTU was highlighted in the Clinical Cancer Advances 2021  report as one of two significant \nadvancements in the “ASCO Clinical Advance of the Year: Molecular Profiling Driving Progress in GI \nCancers,” based on data from both the DESTINY -CRC01  and DESTINY -Gastric01  trials, as well as one of \nthe targeted therapy advances of the year in  non- small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ), based on the interim \nresults of the HER2  mutated cohort of the  DESTINY -Lung01 trial.   \n \nIn September 2021, ENHERTU received its fourth Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the U.S . for the \ntreatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received \none or more prior anti -HER2 -based regimens.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd)  in July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the \nmanufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nU.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens in the metastatic setting.  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory t rial. \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen.  \n \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for ef fective contraception.\n5 \n Contraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor pa tients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue f or at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patient s. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis \noccurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 \nto 8.3).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to \nfirst onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2  to 21.0).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile n eutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU.  \nMonitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically \nindicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interru pt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x \n109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile \nneutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or  a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than \n1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who \nreceived ENHERTU 5.4mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 62% of patients. Sixteen \npercent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil \ncount was 23 days (range: 6 to 547). Febrile neutro penia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% \nof patients. Fifty- one percent had Grade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of  \npatients.\n6 \n Left Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2- positive breast cancer who received \nENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY -Gastric01, of \nthe 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with \nENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF \n<50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically \nindicated. When LVEF is >45% and absolu te decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease \nfrom  baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not \nrecovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within \n10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the sam e dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF \nof <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. \nPermanently discont inue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure . \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female pa rtners of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 \nmonths after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic \nHER2 -positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Breast01  \nand Study DS8201- A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by in travenous infusion once every three weeks. \nThe median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were i nterstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, \ncellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of \npatients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in on e patient each \n(0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and \nhemorrhagic shock.\n7 \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and IL D. Dose reductions \noccurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (79%), white \nblood cell count decreased (70%), hemoglobin decreased (70%), neutrophil count decreased (62%), fatigue \n(59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (41%), alanine aminotransferase \nincreased (38%), platelet count decreased (37%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), \ndiarrhea (29%), hypokalemia (26%), and cough (20%).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2- positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma  in DESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly \nor paclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5  to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred  in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, pneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in \n2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred \nin one patient each (0.8%).  \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pne umonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appeti te, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decreased \n(75%), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (72%), lymphocyte count decreas ed \n(70%), platelet count decreased (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), anemia (58%), aspartate \naminotransferase increased (58%), fatigue (55%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (54%), alanine \naminotransferase increased (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), \nblood bilirubin increased (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \n  \nUse in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause\n8 \n fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise fe males of reproductive potential to use \neffective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. \nMales : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception \nduring treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU \nmay impair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatr ic Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2- positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \n26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between \npatients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There wa s a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse \nreactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Of the \n125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6. 4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥ 75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to \nyounger patients.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impai rment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo in Oncology  \nThe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo is powered by our team of world- class scientists that push beyond \ntraditional thinking to create transformative medicines for people with cancer.

In the trial, trastuzumab deruxtecan \ndemonstrated a 72% reduction in the ris k of disease progression or death compared to trastuzumab emtansine \n(T-DM1) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.22- 0.37; p=7.8x10\n-22) in patients with \nHER2 positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with  trastuzumab and a \ntaxane. The median progression- free survival ( PFS)  for patients treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan  was not\n2 \n reached (95% CI: 18.5- NE) compared to 6.8 months for T -DM1 (95% CI: 5.6- 8.2) as assessed by blinded \nindependent central review (B ICR).  In the secondary endpoint analysis of PFS assessed by investigators, \npatients treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan experienced a three -fold improvement in PFS of 25.1 months \n(95% CI: 22.1- NE) compared to 7.2 months (95% CI: 6.8- 8.3) for T -DM1 (HR=0.26; 95% CI: 0.20- 0.35; \np=6.5x10-24). There was a strong trend towards improved overall survival (OS) with trastuzumab deruxtecan  \n(HR=0.56; 95% CI: 0.36- 0.86; p=0.007172), however, this analysis is not yet mature  and is not statistically \nsignificant. Nearly all patients treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan  were alive at one year (94.1%; 95% CI: \n90.3- 96.4) compared to 85.9% of patients treated with T -DM1 (95% CI: 80.9- 89.7). Confirmed objective \nresponse rate (ORR) w as more than doubled in the trastuzumab deruxtecan  arm versus the T -DM1 arm \n(79.7%  [n=208; 95% CI: 74.3- 84.4]  versus 34.2% [n=90; 95% CI: 28.5- 40.3; p<0.0001] ). \n \nThe safety profile of the most common adverse events with trastuzumab deruxtecan  in DESTINY -Breast03 \nwas consistent with previous clinical trials with no new safety concerns identified. The most common grade 3 or higher drug- related treatment emergent adverse events in the trastuzumab deruxtecan  arm were \nneutropenia (19.1%), thrombocytopenia (7.0%) , leukopenia (6.6%), nausea (6.6%), anemia (5.8%), fatigue \n(5.1%), vomiting (1.6%), increase in ALT (1.6%), decreased appetite (1.2%), increase in AST (0.8%), diarrhea (0.4%) and alopecia (0.4%). Overall, 10.5% of patients had interstitial lung disease (IL D) or \npneumonitis related to treatment as determined by an independent adjudication committee. The majority of ILD events (9.7%) were low grade (grade 1 (2.7%) or grade 2 (7.0%)) with two grade 3 (0.8%) events reported. No grade 4 or grade 5 ILD or pneumonitis events occurred.  \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is  the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide .1 More than two million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020 , resulting in nearly \n685,000 deaths globally.1 In Japan, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with approximately \n92,000 cases of breast cancer diagnosed in 2020.2  \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers.8 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a \nresult of HER2  gene amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in \nbreast cancer.9 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positiv e.3,4 \n \nDespite initial treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane, patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer \nwill often experience disease progression .5 More effective options are needed to further delay progression \nand extend surviv al.5,6,7\n3 \n About DESTINY- Breast03   \nDESTINY -Breast03  is a global, head -to-head, randomized, open- label , pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating  the \nefficacy and safety  of trastuzumab deruxtecan  (5.4 mg/kg) versus T -DM1 in patients with HER2 positive \nunresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and  a taxane. The primary \nefficacy endpoint of DESTINY -Breast03 is PFS based on blinded independent central review. Secondary \nefficacy endpoints include OS, ORR , duration of response , PFS based on investigator assessment  and safety . \nDESTINY -Breast03 enrolled 524 patient s at multiple sites in Asia, Europe , North America, Oceania and \nSouth America .

ENHERTU is a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (AD C) being \njointly developed by Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo)  and AstraZeneca \n(LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN). Results were presented as a n oral presentation ( Abstract #GS3 -01) at the  San \nAntonio Breast Cancer (#SABCS2021) 2021 Symposium.  \n \nA similar  PFS and ORR benefit was observed in exploratory analyses in  patient s defined by presence of \nstable brain metastases, hormone receptor status, number of prior lines of therapy, prior treatme nt with \npertuzumab  or status of visceral metastasis.  In patients with stable brain metastases at baseline,  treatment \nwith ENHERTU resulted in higher PFS  compared to T -DM1  (n=82; PFS by blinded independent central \nreview [ BICR],  hazard ratio [HR]  = 0.25; 95% CI: 0.13 -0.45) . Additionally, i n this subgroup at data cut off  \non May 21, 2021, ENHERTU improved P FS to a median of 15.0 months  (95% CI : 12.5- 22.2)  versus 3.0 \nmonths for T -DM1  (95% CI : 2.8-5.8). In the primary data analysis recently presented  at the 2021 European \nSociety of Medical Oncology (ESMO) virtual conference, ENHERTU demonstrated a 72% reduction in the \nrisk of disease progression or death compared to T -DM1 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.22- 0.37; \np=7.8x10-22). \n \n“The main goals in the treatment of HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer , including those  with stable brain \nmetastases , are to improve symptoms, stabilize o r reduce the tumor size and improve overall survival,” said \nSara Hurvitz, MD, Medical Oncologist, Professor of Medicine, and Director of the Breast Cancer Clinical \nTrials Program in the Division of Hematology -Oncology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA , \nand Medical Director for the Clinical Research Unit at the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center in \nSanta Monica, CA . “The higher progression- free survival  seen in DESTINY -Breast03  in the subgroup of \npatients w ith stable  brain metastases at baseline in this study are encouraging and underscores the excitement\n2 \n around  another  potential option for patients who have experienced disease progression on currently available \ntherapies.”  \n \nConfirmed ORR f or patients with stable brain metastases  at baseline  (n=82) was 67.4% ( n=29; 95% CI: 51.5-\n80.9)  in the ENHERTU arm compared to 20.5%  (n=8; 95% CI:9.3- 36.5)  in the T -DM1 arm . There were two \nconfirmed responses (CR) (4.7%) and 27 partial responses (PR) (62.8%) in patients with stable brain \nmetastases treated with ENHERTU compared to zero CRs and eight  PRs (20.5%)  in those treated with T -\nDM1.  At data cutoff, one (2.3%) patient  with brain metastases treated with ENHERTU  had progressive \ndisease (PD) versus seven  (17.9%) of those treated with T -DM1.  A retrospective non- prespecified  evaluation \nof intracranial response , evaluated using BICR , among 72 patients with stable brain metastases showed that \ntreatment with ENHERTU resulted in 10 CRs  (27.8%)  and 13 PRs  (36.1%) , compared to one CR  (2.8%)  and \n11 PRs  (30.6%)  in those treated with T -DM1 , providing preliminary evidence  that treatment with \nENHERTU is associated with intracranial  tumor  response and reduction in CNS disease.   \n \nThe safety profile of the most common adverse events with ENHERTU  in DESTINY -Breast03  remains \nconsistent with previous clinical trials  of ENHERTU in breast cancer  with no new safety concerns identified. \nThe most common grade 3 or higher treatment emergent adverse events were neutropenia (19.1%), \nthrombocytopenia (7.0%), nausea (6.6%), leukopenia (6.6%), anemia (5.8%), fatigue (5.1%), vomiting \n(1.6%), increase  in ALT (1.6%), decreased appetite (1.2%), increase in AST (0.8%), diarrhea (0.4%) and \nalopecia (0.4%). Overall, 10.5% of patients had confirmed interstitial lung disease (ILD)  or pneumonitis  \nrelated to treatment as determined by an independent adjudication committee . The majority of ILD events  \n(9.7%)  were primarily low grade ( grade 1 (2.7%) or grade 2 ( 7.0%)) with two  grade 3 ( 0.8%) events \nreported. N o grade 4 or grade 5 ILD or pneumonitis events occurred.   \n “The se additional analys es from DESTINY -Breast03 continue to demonstrate  the benefit  of ENHERTU  \ncompared to T -DM1  in patient subgroups , including 15 month progression- free survival in those with stable \nbrain metastases, illustrating the potential of this  treatment  to become the new standard of care in patients \nwith previously treated HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer ,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, \nR&D , Daiichi Sankyo. “ These data  will support our ongoing conversations  with global health authorities to \nrealize our commitment to bring ENHERTU to patients  with previously treated HER2 positive breast cancer \nearlier in the metastatic setting .”  \n \n“More treatment options are needed to delay progression and extend survival for patients with HER2 positive \nmetastatic breast cancer who develop brain metastases, ” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive \nVice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca.  “These additional analyses from DESTINY -Breast03 \nreinforce the potential of ENHERTU with similar benefits in the different subgroups .”\n3 \n Summary of DESTINY- Breast03 S ubgroup A nalyses  \n \n  Median PFS by BICR (95% CI)  ORR  % (95% CI)  \n ENHERTU  T-DM1  ENHERTU  T-DM1  \nAll Patients \n(n=524)  NE (18.5 -NE) 6.8 (5.6 -8.2) 79.7 34.2 \n HR= 0.2840 (0.2165-0.3727) 45.5 (37.6 -53.4)a \nHormone Receptor  \nPositive (n=272)  22.4 (17.7 -NE) 6.9 (4.2 -9.8) 78.2 30.9 \n HR= 0.3191 (0.22 17-0.4594) 47.3 (36.1 -58.4)a \nNegative (n=248)  NE (18.0 -NE) 6.8 (5.4 -8.3) 81.7 38.5 \n HR= 0.2965  (0.20 08-0.4378)  43.2 (31.5 -55.0)a \nPrior Pertuzumab  \nYes (n=320)  NE (18.5 -NE) 6.8 (5.4 -8.3) 79.6 32.9 \n HR= 0.3050 (0.2185-0.4257)  46.7 (36.5 -56.9)a \nNo (n=204)  NE (1 6.5-NE) 7.0 (4.2-9.7) 79.8 36.2 \n HR= 0.2999 (0.19 24-0.4675) 43.6 (30.5 -56.7)a \nVisceral Disease  \nYes (n=384)  22.2 (16.5 -NE) 5.7 (4.2 -7.0) 77.4 29.1 \n HR= 0.2806 (0.2083-0.3779) 48.3 (39.1 -57.6)a  \nNo (n=140)  NE (NE -NE) 11.3 (6.8 -NE) 86.4 47.3 \n HR= 0.3157  (0.17 18-0.5804)  39.1 (23.6 -54.6)a  \nPrior Lines of Therapyb  \n0-1 (n=258)  22.4 (17.9 -NE) 8.0 (5.7 -9.7) 75.0 35.7 \n HR= 0.3302 (0.2275-0.4794) 39.3 (27.3 -51.2)a \n≥2 (n=266)  NE (16.8 -NE) 5.6 (4.2 -7.1) 84.5 32.8 \n HR= 0.2828 (0.19 33-0.4136)  51.6 (40.9 -62.4)a  \nPatients with Stable Brain Metastases at Baseline  \nYes (n=82)  15.0 (12.5 -22.2)  3.0 (2.8 -5.8) 67.4 20.5 \n HR= 0.2465 (0.13 41-0.4529)  46.9 (25.6 -68.3)a  \nNo (n=442)  NE (22.4 -NE) 7.1 (5.6 -9.7) 82.1 36.6 \n HR= 0.2971  (0.2199-0.4014)  45.5 (36.9 -54.1)a  \nCI, confidence interval;  HR, hazard ratio; PFS, progression-free survival ; NE, not estimable ; ORR, objective response rate  \na Absolute ORR Difference, % [ENHERTU-T -DM1] \nb Patients with rapid progression on (neo)adjuvant therapy were included .

ENHERTU c onsists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients  with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 \nbased regimens based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n ENHERTU (6.4 m g/kg) is also approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ)  adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the res ults from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.  \n A Type II Variation is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen.  \n ENHERTU is approved in the U .S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see the accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide . \n About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global developmen t program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combination with other anti cancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n ENHERTU was highlighted in the  Clinical Cancer Advances 2021  report as one of two significant \nadvancements in the “ASCO Clin ical Advance of the Year: Molecular Profiling Driving Progress in GI \nCancers,” based on data from both the DESTINY -Gastric01  and DESTINY -CRC01  trials, as well as one of \nthe targeted therapy advances of the year in non- small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) based on the interim results \nof the HER2  mutated cohort of the  DESTINY -Lung01 trial. \n \nIn May 2020, ENHERTU received \nBTD  in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC  \nwhose tumors have a HER2  mutation and with disease progression on or after platinum -based therapy.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd)  in July 2020, except in Japan where\n6 \n Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the \nmanufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nU.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens in the metastatic setting.  \n \nThis indication is a pproved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen.  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for ef fective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor pa tients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue f or at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patient s. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis \noccurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 \nto 8.3).\n7 \n  \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to \nfirst onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2  to 21.0).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile n eutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU.  \nMonitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically \nindicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interru pt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x \n109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile \nneutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or  a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than \n1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who \nreceived  ENHERTU 5.4mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 62% of patients. Sixteen \npercent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil \ncount was 23 days (range: 6 to 547). Febrile neutropenia wa s reported in 1.7% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% \nof patients. Fifty- one percent had Grade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. In the 234 pat ients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who received \nENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY -Gastric01, of \nthe 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with \nENHERTU has not been studied in patients wi th a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF \n<50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically \nindicated. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease fr om baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease \nfrom baseline is 1 0-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not \nrecovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When L VEF is <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF \nof <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. \nPermanently discontinue ENHERTU i n patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure . \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive poten tial to use effective contraception during treatment and for \nat least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of\n8 \n reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at l east 4 \nmonths after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia ( platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic \nHER2 -positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Breast01  \nand Study DS8201- A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. \nThe median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of \npatients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each \n(0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and \nhemorrhagic shock.  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%)  associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions \noccurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (> 2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (79%), white blood cell count decreased (70%), hemoglobin decreased (70%), neutrophil count  decreased (62%), fatigue \n(59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (41%), alanine aminotransferase \nincreased (38%), platelet count decreased (37%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), \ndiarrhea (29% ), hypokalemia (26%), and cough (20%).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2- positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma  in DESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly \nor paclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5  to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were  decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in \n2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred \nin one patient each (0.8%).  \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reacti ons (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most\n9 \n frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormali ties, were hemoglobin decreased \n(75%), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (72%), lymphocyte count decreased \n(70%), platelet count decreased (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), anemia (58%), aspartate \naminotransfer ase increased (58%), fatigue (55%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (54%), alanine \naminotransferase increased (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), blood bilirubin increased (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \n Use in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient beco mes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adver se reactions in a \nbreastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contracepti on during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. \nMales : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception \nduring treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU \nmay impair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2- positive breast cancer  treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \n26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3- 4 adverse \nreactions observed  in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Of the \n125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% wer e ≥75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monito r for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo in Oncology  \nThe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo is powered by our team of world- class scientists that push beyond \ntraditional thinking to create transformative medicines for people with cancer.

    "content": "Press Release  \n \nDatopotamab Deruxtecan Continues to Show Promising Durable \nResponse and Disease Control  in Patients with Metastatic Triple  \nNegative Breast Cancer  \n \n• Updated  data from  the TNBC  cohort of the TROPION -PanTumor01 phase 1 trial of Daiichi Sankyo and \nAstraZeneca’s datopotamab deruxtecan featured as oral presentation at SABCS  \n \nTokyo, Munich and Basking Ridge, NJ – (December 7, 2021)  – New  data f rom the TROPION -\nPanTumor01  phase 1 trial of datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd), a TROP2 directed DXd antibody drug \nconjugate (ADC) being developed by Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi S ankyo) and \nAstraZeneca  (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) , continue to show encouraging  durable tumor response and disease \ncontrol  in patients with metastatic triple  negative breast cancer (TNBC)  with disease progression following  \nstandard treatment . These data  were  featured  during a n oral presentation (GS1-05) at the 2021 San Antonio \nBreast Cancer Symposium (#SABCS21).  \n \nTNBC accounts for a pproximately 10  to 15 % of  breast cancer cases  and is associated with higher disease \nrecurrence and worse prognosis compared to other breast cancer subtypes.1,2,3 It is estimated that only 12.2% \nof patients with metastatic TNBC survive five years  and median overall survival is generally less than two \nyears .2,3  \n \nAn objective response rate (ORR) of 34% was observed in 15 of 44 patients treated with datopotamab \nderuxtecan (6 mg/kg  [n=42]  and 8 mg/kg  [n=2] ) as assessed by blinded independent central review. F ourteen \nconfirmed complete/partial responses ( CR/PRs)  with one additional CR/PR  awaiting confirmation and stable \ndisease in 17 additional patients  were reported after a median follow -up of 7.6 months (range, 4 – 13 \nmonths). Median duration of response (DOR) was not  reached (range, 2.7 – 7.4+ months) with the majority \nongoing at the data cut -off of July 30,  2021. A disease control rate (DCR) of 77% wa s observed.  \n \nIn a subgroup of 27 patients with measurable disease and previously untreated with a topoisomerase I \ninhibitor -based ADC , an ORR of 52% was reported with datopotamab deruxtecan. Thirteen confirmed \nCR/PRs with one additional CR/PR  awaiting conf irmation and stable disease  were  reported in nine additional \npatients after a median follow -up of 8.8 months (range, 4 – 13 months). A DCR  of 81% was observed in this \nsubgroup of patients.\n2 \n “Despite recent advances  in the treatment of triple negative breast cancer , a significant need  remains to  \nimprove  patient outcomes , underscoring the importance of develop ing new and effective therapies ,” said Ian \nE. Krop, MD, PhD, Associate Chief, Division of Breast Oncology, Susan F. Smith Center for Women’s \nCancers, Dana Farber Cancer Institute.  “These preliminary results with datopotamab deruxtecan in pre -\ntreated patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer are very encouraging and further evaluation of \nthis TROP2 directed ADC is warranted .”  \n \nThe overall safety profile of datopotamab deruxtecan  in TNBC  in TROPION -PanTumor01  was consistent \nwith what has been previously reported  with no new safety signals . Treatment emergent adverse events \n(TEAEs) occurring in  ≥15% of patients included nausea, stomatitis, vomiting, fatigue,  alopecia,  mucosal  \ninflammation, constipation, headache, decreased lymphocyte count, decreased neutro phil count , pyrexia, \nanemia , pruritis, hypokalemia, diarrhea and cough . Grade 3 or greater treatment -related TEAEs occurred in \n23% of patients. No cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) were observed.   \n \n“These updated results continue to show the promise of datopot amab deruxtecan as a durable treatment \nstrategy for patients with previously treated triple negative breast cancer, a historically difficult -to-treat form \nof breast cancer,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, Oncolog y \nDevelopment, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo.  “We are committed to further developing datopotamab \nderuxtecan and e stablishing where this specifically engineered TROP2 may be most effective  in treating \ntriple negative breast cancer.”   \n \n“Patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer  face rapid disease progression with currently available \ntreatment options  and unmet need remains high for these patients ,” said Cristian Massacesi, MD, Chief \nMedical Officer and Oncology Chief Develop ment Officer, AstraZeneca. “Based on the se encouraging \nresults  of datopotamab deruxtecan in the triple negative breast cancer cohort of TROPION -PanTumor01, \nplans are underway to initiate a registrational phase 3 study .”  \n \nPatients were treated with a median of three  prior therapies in the metastatic setting  (range, 1 -10), including \ntaxanes (91%), platinum -based chemotherapy (52%), immunotherapy ( 43%), topoisomerase I inhibitor -based \nADC s (30%; sacituzumab govitecan, n=10; trastuzumab deruxtecan, n=2; patritumab deruxtecan, n=1 ) and \nPARP inhibitor s (16%). As of data cut -off on July 30, 2021 , 30% of patients remained on treatment with \ndatopotamab deruxtecan .\n3 \n Summary of TROPION -PanTumor01 TNBC Results  \n \nEfficacy Measure  All TNBC Patients \n(n=44)i,  Patients without Prior  Topo isomerase  I-\nBased ADC and with Measurable Disease \n(n=27)ii \nORR, %  34% (n=15)  52% (n=14)  \n  (CR/PR) (confirmed)      n=14     n=13  \n  (CR/PR) (pending confirmation)      n=1iii     n=1iii \nSD, %  39% ( n=17)  33% (n=9)  \nPD, %  18% (n=8)  15% (n=4)  \nDCR, %  77% (n= 34) 81% (n=22)  \nCR; complete response; DCR, disease control rate; ORR, objective response rate; PD, progressive disease;  PR, partial response ; SD, stable disease  \n \ni Includes response evaluable patients who had ≥1 postbaseline tumor assessment or discontinued treatment. Postbaseline tumor assessments were no t \nyet available for 2 patients at the data cut -off. Three patients were not confirmed to have a target lesion per BICR and therefor e had a best overall \nresponse of non -CR/non -PD. \nii Includes response evaluable patients who had ≥1 postbaseline tumor assessment or discontinued treatment. Postbaseline tumor a ssessments were not  \nyet available for 1 patient at the data cut -off. \niii Includes patients with an unconfirmed response but are on going treatment.  \n \nAbout TROPION -PanTumor01  \nTROPION -PanTumor01  is a first -in-human, open -label, two -part, multicenter phase 1 trial evaluating the \nsafety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of datopotamab deruxtecan in patients with advanced solid \ntumors refractory to or relapsed from standard treatment or for who m no standard treatment is available, \nincluding non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TNBC, hormone receptor (HR) positive /HER2 negative  \nbreast  cancer , small cell lung cancer,  urothelial, gastric and esophageal cancer . \n \nThe dose escalation part of the study , which was limited to patients with NSCLC , assessed the safety and \ntolerability of increasing doses of datopotamab deruxtecan to determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or \nrecommended dose for expansion. The dose expansion part of the study further assessed the safety and \ntolerability of datopotamab deruxtecan in patients with additional solid tumors . Based on the preliminary \nefficacy and safety profile, the 6 mg/kg dose has been chosen for further development.4,5  \n \nSafety endpoints include dose li miting toxicities and serious adverse events. Efficacy endpoints include \nORR, DCR , DOR, time to response, progression -free survival and overall survival. Pharmacokinetic, \nbiomarker and immunogenicity endpoints also are being evaluated.  \n \nAbout Triple Negati ve Breast Cancer  \nApproximately 10 to 15% of breast cancer s are considered triple negative , a breast cancer subtype that is \ndefined by  tumors  that test negative for estrogen  and progesterone hormone receptors (HRs)  as well as  \nhuman epidermal growth factor 2 receptor (HER2 ).1,2,6 An estimated 260,000 new cases of TNBC were\n4 \n reported globally in 2018 with it being more common in younger women and those who are Black .1,2,7 \nCompared to patients with other breast cancer subtypes, prognosis for patients with metastatic TNBC is \ngenerally worse and the disease is more likely to recur following treatment with initi al chemotherapy.1,3 Five-\nyear survival of metastatic TNBC is estimated at 12.2% and median overall survival is generally less than \ntwo years.2,9  \n \nAbout TROP2  \nTROP2 (trophoblast cell -surface antigen 2) is a transmembrane glycoprotein overexpressed in several types \nof solid tumors, including breast cancer.8 TROP2 overexpression has been detected in multiple  breast cancer \nsubtypes, including approximately 80% of patients with TNBC .9,10,11 High TROP2 expression is an \nunfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival in all types of breast cancer.12 \n \nAbout Datopotamab Deruxtecan (Dato -DXd)  \nDatopotamab deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd)  is an investigational TROP2 directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi \nSankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, datopotamab deruxtecan is one of three lead ADCs in the \noncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanced programs in AstraZeneca’s AD C \nscientific platform . Datopotamab deruxtecan is comprised of a humanized anti -TROP2 IgG13 monoclonal \nantibody, developed in collaboration with Sapporo Medical University,  attached to a topoisomerase I  \ninhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.13 \n \nA comprehensive development program called TROPION is underway globally with trials evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan across multiple solid  tumors, including NSCLC , TNBC , HR \npositive/HER2 negative breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, urothelial, gastric and esophageal cancer. \nTrials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \ndatopotamab deruxtecan in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. \nDaiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo in Oncology  \nThe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo is powered by our team of world -class scientists that push beyond \ntraditional thinking to create transformative medicines for people with cancer.

The company’s t hree lead ADCs include  ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC , \ndatopotamab deruxtecan ( Dato -DXd ), a TROP2 directed ADC, which are being jointly developed and \ncommercialized globally with AstraZeneca; and patritumab deruxtecan ( HER3 -DXd) , a HER3 directed ADC . \nTwo a dditional  ADCs , DS-7300 (B7- H3) and DS-6000 (CDH6) , are being developed through a strategic \ncollaboration with Sarah Cannon Research Institute . \n \nEach ADC is designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology to tar get and deliver \nchemotherapy inside cancer cells that express a specific cell surface antigen.  Each ADC is composed of a \nmonoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload (an exatecan derivative,  DXd)  via a \ntetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg)  (trastuzumab deruxtecan ; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in U.S. only)  is approved in \nmore than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast \ncancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 based regimens based on the results from the \nDESTINY- Breast01  trial.   \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg)  is approved in Israel, Japan, Singapore  and U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY- Gastric01  trial. A\n4 Type II Variation is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency  (EMA) for the treatment of \nadult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric  or GEJ  adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen . \n \nENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see the accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide . \n \nDatopotamab deruxtecan , patritumab deruxteca n, DS -7300 and DS -6000 are investigational medicines that have \nnot been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.  \n \nU.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have rec eived two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens in the metastatic setting.  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. \nContinued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verific ation and description of clinical benefit \nin a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen.  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respira tory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all \npatients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occ ur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a \npulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0,\n5 then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual \ntaper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated with \nENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred \nin 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY- Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ \nadenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset \nwas 2.8 months (range: 1.2 to 21.0).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU.  \nMonitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically \nindicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) \ninterrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC \n<1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer wh o received \nENHERTU 5.4mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 62% of patients. Sixteen percent had \nGrade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 23 days \n(range: 6 to 547). Febrile neut ropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY- Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ \nadenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of \npatients. Fifty -one percent had Grade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased \nneutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of  patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. In  the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who received \nENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY -Gastric01, of the \n125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive ga stric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on echocardiography, \n8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of \ntreatment.  \n Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. \nWhen LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10- 20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. \nWhen LVEF is 40- 45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and \nrepeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -\n20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within \n10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline,\n6 resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is \n>20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHER TU. Permanently discontinue \nENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure . \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. \nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with  female partners of reproductive \npotential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last \ndose of ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast C ancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic \nHER2 -positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Breast01  \nand Study DS8201- A-J101. ENHERTU was administ ered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The \nmedian duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).   Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% \nof patients who received ENHE RTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, \nhypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients \nincluding interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute \nhepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, \nleukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nause a, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of \npatients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction \nwere fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (79%), white blood cell count decreased (70%), hemoglobin decreased (70%), neutrophil count decreased (62%), fatigue (59%), \nvomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (41%), alanine aminotransferase increased \n(38%), platelet count decreased (37%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), diarrhea \n(29%), hypokalemia (26%), and cough (20%).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric \nor GEJ adenocarcinoma  in DESTINY- Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of either \nENHERTU (N=125) 6.4  mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly or \npaclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to 22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5 to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse reactions \nin >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, pneumonia, \ncholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 2.4% of\n7 patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred in one patient \neach (0.8%).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions \ndue to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions \n(>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, leukopenia, fatigue, \nthrombocytopenia, ILD , pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, and hypokalemia. \nDose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) \nassociated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decreased \n(75%), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (72%), lymphocyte count de creased \n(70%), platelet count decreased (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), anemia (58%), aspartate \naminotransferase increased (58%), fatigue (55%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (54%), alanine \naminotransferase increased (47%), diarrhea ( 32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), \nblood bilirubin increased (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \n \nUse in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the \npotential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the l ast dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed \nchild, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed \nchild, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contracep tion: Females : ENHERTU can cause fetal \nharm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective \ncontraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male p atients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may \nimpair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2- positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, 26% \nwere ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in eff icacy were observed between patients ≥65 \nyears of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3- 4 adverse reactions \nobserved in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Of the 125 patients with \nlocall y advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU \n6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥ 65 years and 14% were ≥ 75 years. No overall differences in \nefficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of ag e compared to younger patients.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1- 877-437-7763 or FDA \nat 1- 800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Informa tion, including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo in Oncology  \nThe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo is powered by our team of world- class scientists that push beyond \ntraditional thinking to create transformative medicines for people with cancer.

    "content": "1 \n  \nPress Release \n \nDESTINY- Breast 11 Neoadjuvant Phase 3 Trial of ENHERTU® \nInitiated in Patients with High -Risk HER2 Positive Early -Stage  Breast \nCancer \n  \nTokyo, Munich  and Basking Ridge, NJ – (November 30, 2021)  – Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited \n(hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) today announced that the first patient was dosed in the  global  DESTINY-\nBreast11  phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan) , a HER2 \ndirected antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being joi ntly developed by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca  \n(LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) , as a neoadjuvant therapy in patients with high- risk HER2 positive early- stage \nbreast cancer.  \n \nDESTINY- Breast11 will evaluate ENHERTU as a monotherapy or ENHERTU followed by paclitaxel, \ntrastuzumab and pertuzumab ( THP) compared to the standard of care regimen of doxorubicin and \ncyclophosphamide followed by paclit axel, trastuzumab and pertuzumab  (ddAC-THP) in patients with  high-\nrisk (lymph node positive [N1- 3] or with a primary tumor stage T3- 4), locally advanced or inflammatory,  \nHER2 positive early -stage breast cancer .  \n \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide with more than two million cases diagnosed in 2020, \nresulting in nearly 685,000 deaths globally.1 About 60% of women with breast cancer are diagnosed with \nearly -stage breast ca ncer.2 The current standard of care in the neoadjuvant setting of HER2 positive early-\nstage breast cancer consists of a multi -agent regimen of dual HER2 targeted therapy with three different \nchemotherapy agents .3 While the goal of this regimen  is to achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR) , or \nthe absence of active cancer cells  prior to surgery,  it is associated with significant  toxicity.3,4 Additionally, \nsome patients will experience disease relapse or progression.3 Replacing the standard of care  with \nENHERTU or displacing anthracyclines with ENHERTU followed by THP may  potentially improve \noutcomes and could reduce treatment burden and overall toxicity in patients  not benefiting from standard of \ncare therapy . \n \n“DESTINY- Breast11 is the first trial to  evaluate ENHERTU in the neoadjuvant setting in patients  with high-\nrisk HER2 positive early- stage breast cancer ,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice \nPresident, Global Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “ The goal of this study is\n2 \n to determine if ENHERTU  alone or followed by chemotherapy can potentially replace the current standar d of \ncare or displace the use of anthr acyline s in the neoa djuvant setting .”  \n \nAbout DESTINY- Breast 11 \nDESTINY- Breast 11 is a global , randomized, open- label, phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety  of \nneoadjuvant ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg)  monotherapy or ENHERTU followed by THP as compared to the  \nstandard of care regimen  ddAC -THP in patients with high- risk (lymph node positive [N1- 3] or with a \nprimary tumor stage T3- 4), locally advanced or inflammatory HER2 positive early -stage breast cancer .  \n \nPatients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either  eight cycles of ENHERTU as a monotherapy; four cycles \nof ENHERTU followed by four cycles of THP ; or four cycles of ddAC followed by four cycles of THP . The \nprimary endpoint of DESTINY- Breast 11 is pCR (absence of invasive disease in the breast and lymph nodes)  \nas assessed by blinded independent central review  (BICR) . Secondary endpoints include e vent-free survival , \ninvasive disease -free survival , overall survival , pharmacokinetics , immunogenicity and safety . \n \nDESTINY- Breast11 will enroll approximately 624 patients at multiple sites across Asia, Europe, North  \nAmerica and South America . For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.1 More than two million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020, resulting in  nearly \n685,000 deaths  globally.1 About 60% of women with breast cancer are diagnosed with early -stage breast \ncancer .2  \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth- promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers.5 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a \nresult of  HER2  gene amplification a nd is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in \nbreast cancer.6 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.7 \n \nThe current standard of care in the neoadjuvant setting of HER2 positive early -stage breast cancer consists of \na multi- agent regimen of dual HER2 targeted therapy with three different chemotherapy agents.3 While the \ngoal of this regimen is to achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR) , or the absence of active cancer cells \nprior to surgery, it is associated with significant toxicity .3,4 Additionally, some patients will experience \ndisease relapse or progression.3 Replacing the standard of care  with ENHERTU or displacing anthracyclines \nwith ENHERTU followed by THP may  potentially improve outcomes and could reduce treatment burden \nand overall toxicity in patients  not benefiting from standard of care therapy .\n3 \n About ENHERTU  \nENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2  \ndirected antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC \ntechnology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced \nprogram in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.  ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody \nattached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based \ncleavable linker.  \n \nENHERT U (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in more than 30 countries for the treatment of adult patients with \nunresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 \nbased regimens based on the results from the DESTINY- Breast01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is also approved in Israel, Japan , Singapore  and U.S. for the treatment of adult \npatients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) \nadenocarcinoma who have received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from \nthe DESTINY- Gastric01  trial.  A Type II Variation is currently under review by the European Medicines \nAgency (EMA) for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric \nor GEJ adenocarcinoma who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen . \n ENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see the accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide .  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Progra m \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric , lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combination with other ant icancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n ENHERTU was highlighted in the  Clinical Cancer Advances 2021  report as one of two significant \nadvancements in the “ASCO Clinical Advance of the Year: Molecular Profiling Driving Progress in GI \nCancers,” based on data from both the  DESTINY- CRC01  and DESTINY- Gastric01  trials, as well as one of \nthe targeted therapy advances of the year in  non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ), based on the interim \nresults of the HER2  mutated cohort of the  DESTINY- Lung01 trial.  \n \nIn September 2021, ENHERTU received its fourth Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) in the U.S for \nthe treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have \nreceive d one or more prior anti -HER2 -based regimens.\n4 \n  \nAbout  the Daiichi Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd)  in July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the \nmanufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and da topotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nU.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens in the metas tatic setting.  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen.  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for ef fective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor pa tients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue f or at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.\n5 \n  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patient s. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis \noccurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 \nto 8.3).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY- Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to \nfirst onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2 to 21.0).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU.  Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically \nindicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 10\n9/L) interru pt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x \n109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile \nneutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or  a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than \n1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who \nreceived ENHERTU 5.4mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 62% of patients. Sixteen \npercent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil \ncount was 23 days (range: 6 to 547). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY- Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in n eutrophil count was reported in 72% \nof patients. Fifty -one percent had Grade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. In the 234 pat ients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who received \nENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY -Gastric01, of \nthe 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ  adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with \nENHERTU has not been studied in patients wi th a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF \n<50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically \nindicated. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease fr om baseline is 10- 20%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease \nfrom baseline is 1 0-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not \nrecovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within \n10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When L VEF is <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF \nof <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. \nPermanently discontinue ENHERTU i n patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure .\n6 \n  \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive pot ential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \nat least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive pote ntial to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 \nmonths after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia For Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was  evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic \nHER2 -positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Breast01  \nand Study DS8201- A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. \nThe median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung dise ase, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, \ncellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of \npatients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each \n(0.4%) : acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and \nhemorrhagic shock.  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurr ed in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions \noccurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (79%), white \nblood cell count decreased (70%), hemoglobin decreased (70%), neutrophil count decreased (62%), fatigue \n(59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (41%), alanine aminotransferase \nincreased (38%), platelet count  decreased (37%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), \ndiarrhea (29%), hypokalemia (26%), and cough (20%).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or me tastatic HER2 -positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma  in DESTINY- Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly \nor paclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to 22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5 to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHER TU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, pneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 2.4% of patie nts: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred \nin one patient each (0.8%).\n7 \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respirat ory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile ne utropenia.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decreased \n(75%), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (72%), lymphocyte count decreased \n(70%), platelet count decreased (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), anemia (58%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (58%), fatigue (55%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (54%), alanine aminotransferase increased (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%),  constipation (24%), \nblood bilirubin increased (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \n Use in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There ar e clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a \nbreastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproducti ve potential to use \neffective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. \nMales : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception \nduring treatment with ENH ERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU \nmay impair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2 -positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \n26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between \npatients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidenc e of Grade 3 -4 adverse \nreactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Of the \n125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥ 65 years and 14% were ≥ 75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to poten tially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n Please see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n About Daiichi Sankyo in Oncology  \nThe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo is powered by our team of world- class scientists that push beyond \ntraditional thinking to create transformative medicines for people with cancer.

In this setting, the \nunmet need is high , and new therapeutic approaches  are necessary to delay  disease progression and extend  \nsurvival ,” said Cristian Massacesi, MD, Chief Medical Officer and Oncology Chief Development Officer, \nAstraZeneca. “The TROPION -Breast01 trial will  evaluate  whether datopotamab deruxtecan  may be a more \neffective treatment  than chemotherapy for patients with previously treated HR positive, HER2 negative \nadvanced breast cancer  previously treated with one to two  lines of chemotherapy .”\n2 \n About TROPION -Breast01  \nTROPION -Breast01 is a global , randomi zed, open -label, phase 3 trial evalua ting the efficacy and safety     \nof datopotamab deruxtecan  (6 mg/kg)  compared with investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (eribulin, \ncapecitabine,  vinorelbine or gemcitabine)  in patients with inoperable or metastatic HR  positive, HER2  \nnegative  breast cancer  (per ASCO/CAP guidelines , on local laboratory results)  who have progressed on or \nwere not suitable for endocrine therapy and previously  treated with one or two prior lines of systemic \nchemotherapy  in the inoperable  or metastatic setting .  \n \nThe dual primary endpoints of TROPION -Breast01  are progression -free sur vival  (PFS)  assessed by blinded \nindependent central review  and overall survival. Secondary endpoints include PFS assessed by investigator, \nobjective response rat e, duration of response , disease control rate , and patient reported outcomes,  as well as \nsafety and pharmacokinetics.   \n \nTROPION -Breast01  will enroll  approximately 700 patients at sites in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America \nand South America. For more information visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout H R Positive, HER2 Negative Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.  More than two million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020 , resulting in  nearly \n685,000 deaths  globally .1 Approximately  5% to 10% of women diagnosed with breast cancer have \nmetastatic disease at diagnosis , and up to 30% of women with early -stage breast cancer will develop \nmetastatic disease.4  \n \nApproximately 70% of all breast cancers a re considered HR positive, HER2 negat ive, meaning tumors test \npositive for estrogen  and/or  progesterone hormone receptors and negative for HER2.2 Current standard of \ncare treatment for patients with HR positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer that progresses on \nhormone  therap y-based regimens  is sequential single -agent chemothera py. However, response rates are low  \nwith PFS rang ing from 4  to 6.3 months with second -line chemotherapy, and 2.4  to 5.5 months with third -\nline chemotherapy.5,6,7,8 Data in subsequent lines of treatment show decreasing median PFS and OS with \neach further line  of chemotherapy. There remains a need to improve outcomes including survival  for \npatients  living with advanced HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer .9  \n \nAbout TROP2  \nTROP2 (trophoblast cell -surface antigen 2) is a transmembrane glycoprotein overexpressed in several types \nof solid tumors, including breast cancer.10 TROP2 expression has been detected in a wide range of breast \ncancer subtypes , including the HR positive, HER2 ne gative subtype .11,12 High TROP2 expression is an\n3 \n unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival in all types of breast cancer .13 There are currently no \nTROP2 directed therapies approved for treatment of HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer.  \n \nAbout Datopotamab Deruxtecan (Dato -DXd)  \nDatopotamab deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd)  is an investigational TROP2 directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi \nSankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, datopotamab deruxtecan is one of three lead ADCs in the \noncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo , and one of the most advanced programs in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific platform . Datopotamab deruxtecan is comprised of a humanized anti -TROP2 IgG13 monoclonal \nantibody , developed in collaboration with Sapporo Medical University , attached to a topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a tetrapep tide-based cleavable linker .14 \n \nA comprehensive development program  called TROPION  is underway globally with trials evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan across multiple solid tumors, including  non-small cell lung \ncancer ( NSCLC ), triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ), HR positive /HER2 negative  breast  cancer , small \ncell lung cancer  (SCLC) , urothelial, gastric and esophageal cancer . Trials in combination with other \nanticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \ndatopotamab deruxtecan in July 2020 , except in Japan where Daii chi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. \nDaiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo in Oncology  \nThe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo is powered by our team of world -class scientists tha t push beyond \ntraditional thinking to create transformative medicines for people with cancer.

    "content": "Press Release  \n \nTrastuzumab Deruxtecan Type II Variation Application Validated by \nEMA for the Treatment of HER2 Positive Advanced Gastric Cancer  \n \n• Application b ased on DESTINY -Gastric01 and DESTINY -Gastric02 phase 2 trials  \n \nTokyo, Munich – (November 3, 2021)  – Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) \ntoday announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated the Type II Variation  \nApplication for trastuzumab deruxtecan, a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC)  being jointly \ndeveloped by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca  (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) , for the treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) \nadenocarcinoma who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen .  \n \nValidation confirms that the application is complete and commences the scientific review process by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Th is application  is based on the positive \nresults from the DESTINY -Gastric01  pivotal phase 2 trial published in The New England Journal of \nMedicine and the  DESTINY -Gastric02  phase 2  trial recently presented  at the 2021 European Society for \nMedical Oncology (ESMO) Congress.  \n “After progression on initial therapy, patients with HER2 positive advanced gastri c cancer are faced with \nlimited options  in Europe , so there is a significant unmet need for new  therapeutic  options ,” said Gilles \nGallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “ We look forward to working with the EMA on its review of this application and to \npotentially bring trastuzumab deruxtecan to physicians and patients in Europe, as it offers the potential to \nprovide an important new  treatment option  to patients with locally  advanced or metastatic HER2 positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who have received a prior anti -HER2 -based regimen .”  \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Gastric Cancer  \nGastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the fourth highest leading cause of cancer mortality, with a five -year global survival rate of 5% to 10% for advanced or metastatic disease.\n1,2,3 \nThere were approximately one million new cases of gastric cancer and 768,000 deaths reported worldwide in 2020.\n4 In Europe, a pproximately 136,000 cases of gastric cancer are diagnosed annually, and  Eastern Europe \nhas the second highest incidence of gastric cancer worldwide after Eastern Asia.3,4 Gastric cancer is the sixth\n2 \n leading cause of cancer death  in Europe, and is typically diagnosed in the advanced stage but even when \ndiagnosed in earlier stages of the disease the survival rate remains modest.3,5,6,7  \n \nApproximately one in five gastric cancers are HER2 positive.8,9 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth \npromoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including breast, gastric, lung and \ncolorectal cancers.9 HER2 overexpression may be associated with a specific HER2 gene alteration known as \nHER2 amplification.9  \n \nRecommended first -line treat ment for HER2 positive advanced or metastatic gastric cancer is combination \nchemotherapy plus trastuzumab, an anti -HER2 medicine, which has been shown to improve survival \noutcomes when added to chemotherapy.10 For patients with metastatic gastric cancer th at progress following \ninitial treatment with a trastuzumab -based regimen, treatment options are limited, and in many regions in the \nworld there are no additional HER2 directed medicines available.1,5, 11  \n About DESTINY- Gastric01  \nDESTINY -Gastric01 is a pivotal, randomized, open -label, multi- center phase 2 trial assessing the safety and \nefficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan (6.4 mg/kg)  in patients from Japan and South Korea with HER2 positive \n(defined as IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+) advanced gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma \nwho have progressed on two or more prior treatment regimens including fluoropyrimidine (5- FU), platinum \nchemotherapy and trastuzumab. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive trastuzumab deruxtecan  or \nphysician’s choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel or irinotecan monotherapy). The primary endpoint of \nDESTINY -Gastric01  is objective response rate ( ORR ). Secondary endpoints include overall sur vival ( OS), \nprogression- free survival ( PFS), duration of response ( DoR ), disease control rate and time to treatment \nfailure as well as pharmacokinetic and safety endpoints.  DESTINY -Gastric01 enrolled 189 patients at \nmultiple sites in Japan and South Korea. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout DESTINY- Gastric02  \nDESTINY -Gastric02 is an open- label, single -arm, phase 2 trial in Western patients evaluating the safety and \nefficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan (6.4 mg/kg) in patients with HER2 positive\n metastatic and/or \nunresectable gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma with disease progression on or after a trastuzumab -containing \nregimen. The primary endpoint  of DESTINY -Gastric02 is confirmed ORR based on independent central \nreview . Secondary endpoints include PFS, OS,  DoR and safety. DESTINY -Gastric02 enrolled 79 patients at \nmultiple sites in North America and Europe.

ENHERTU is a HER2  directed \nantibody drug conjugate (ADC) jointly developed by Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi \nSankyo)  and AstraZeneca.  \n \nThe U.S. FDA’s  BTD is designed to accelerate the development and regulatory review of potential new \nmedicines that are intended to treat a serious condition and address a significant unmet medical need. The \nnew medicine needs to have shown encouraging preliminary clinic al results that demonstrate substantial \nimprovement on a clinically significant endpoint over available medicines.   \n \nBreast cancer remains the most common cancer worldwide, with more than two million cases diagnosed in 2020, resulting in nearly 685,000 dea ths globally.\n1 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are \nconsidered HER2 positive.2 Despite initial treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane, patients with HER2  \npositive metastatic breast cancer will often experience disease progression.3 More  effective options are \nneeded to further delay progression and extend survival .3,4,5  \n \n“By granting a fourth Breakthrough Therapy Designation to ENHERTU, the FDA continues to recognize the \nsignificant potential of this medicine  across multiple HER2 targetable tumors ,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, \nGlobal Head, R&D , Daiichi Sankyo. “ With the unprecedented data recently reported from  the DESTINY-\nBreast03 trial, w e look forward to working closely with the FDA to bring ENHERTU to patients who have \nbeen previously treated for HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer  as soon as possible .”\n2 \n “This is an important step in bringing ENHERTU as a potential new option in earlier lines of treatment for \nHER2 positive metastatic breast cancer , given the urgent need to improve outcomes ,” said Susan Galbraith,  \nMBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “This recognition by the FDA  \nunderscores the  transformative possibility of ENHERTU seen with the remarkable DESTINY -Breast0 3 \nresults presented at ESMO just two weeks ago .”  \n \nThe FDA granted BTD based on data from the DESTINY- Breast03  pivotal trial presented  during the 2021 \nEuropean Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress. In the trial, ENHERTU demonstrated a 72% \nreduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared to T -DM1  (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28; 95% CI: \n0.22- 0.37; p=7.8x10-22) in patients with HER2 positive unresectable and/or metastatic  breast cancer \npreviously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane.  \n \nThe safety profile of the most common adverse event s with ENHERTU in DESTINY- Breast03 was \nconsistent with previous clinical trials with no new safety concerns identified. The most common grade 3 or \nhigher drug- related treatment emergent adverse events in the ENHERTU arm were neutropenia (19.1%), \nthrombocyt openia (7.0%), leukopenia (6.6%), nausea (6.6%), anemia (5.8%), fatigue (5.1%), vomiting \n(1.6%), increase in ALT (1.6%), decreased appetite (1.2%), increase in AST (0.8%), diarrhea (0.4%) and alopecia (0.4%). Overall, 10.5% of patients had interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis related to \ntreatment as determined by an independent adjudication committee. The majority of ILD events (9.7%) were \nlow grade (grade 1 ( 2.7%) or grade 2 ( 7.0%) ) with two grade 3 (0.8%) events reported. No grade 4 or grade 5 \nILD or pneumonitis events occurred.  \n \nPrevious BTDs  for ENHERTU were in late- line HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer in 2017 and HER2  \nmutant metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) an d HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer in 2020.  \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths \nworldwide.1 More than two million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020, resulting in nearly \n685,000 deaths globally.1 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.2  \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth- promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. 6 HER2 protein overexpre ssion may occur as a \nresult of HER2  gene amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in \nbreast cancer.7\n3 \n Despite initial treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane, patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer \nwill often experience disease progression.3 More effective options are needed to further delay progression \nand extend survival.3,4,5 \n \nAbout DESTINY- Breast03   \nDESTINY- Breast03  is a global, head -to-head, randomized, open- label , pivotal  phase 3 trial evaluating  the \nsafety and efficacy of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) versus T -DM1 in patients with HER2 positive unresectable \nand/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and  a taxane. The primary efficacy \nendpoint of DESTINY -Breast03 is progression- free survival ( PFS) based on blinded independent central \nreview. Secondary efficacy endpoints include overall survival , objective response rate, duration of response , \nprogression- free survival  based on investigator assessment  and safety .  \n \nDESTINY- Breast03 enrolled 524 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe , North America, Oceania and \nSouth America . For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n About ENHERTU  \nENHERTU\n® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxte can-nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 \ndirected ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is the lead \nADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific platform. E NHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Canada, EU, Israel, Japan, UK and U.S. for the tre atment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens in the metastatic setting based on the results from the DESTINY- Breast01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is also approved in Israel, Japan and U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen bas ed on the results from the DESTINY- Gastric01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see the accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide .\n4 \n About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2  targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combination with other ant icancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n \nENHERTU was highlighted in the  Clinical Cancer Advances 2021  report as one of two significant \nadvancements in the “ASCO Clinical Advance of the Year: Molecular Profiling Driving Progress in GI \nCancers,” based on data from both the  DESTINY- Gastric01  and DESTINY- CRC01  trials, as well as one of \nthe targeted therapy advances of the year in NSCLC based on the interim results of the HER2  mutated cohort \nof the  DESTINY- Lung01 trial.  \n \nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd)  in July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the \nmanufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nU.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a  HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens in the metastatic setting.  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen.  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for ef fective contraception.\n5 \n Contraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic cortic osteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis \noccurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 \nto 8.3).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY- Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10%  of patients. Median time to \nfirst onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2 to 21.0).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU.  Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically \nindicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 10\n9/L) interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x \n109/L) interrupt ENHERTU  until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile \nneutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than \n1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastat ic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who \nreceived ENHERTU 5.4mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 62% of patients. Sixteen \npercent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease i n neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil \ncount was 23 days (range: 6 to 547). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY- Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% \nof patients. Fifty -one percent had Grade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of \npatients.\n6 \n Left Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who received \nENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY -Gastric01, of \nthe 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however,  on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with \nENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF \n<50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nAssess LVEF  prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically \nindicated. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10- 20%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease \nfrom baseline is 10- 20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not \nrecovered to within 10% from ba seline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within \n10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks . If LVEF \nof <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure . \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when ad ministered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 \nmonths after the last dose of  ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic \nHER2 -positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Breast01  \nand Study DS8201- A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. \nThe median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).   \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, \ncellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adv erse reactions occurred in 4.3% of \npatients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and \nhemorrhagic shock.\n7 \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose i nterruption were neutropenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions \noccurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated \nwith dos e reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (79%), white \nblood cell count decreased (70%), hemoglobin decreased (70%), neutrophil count decreased (62%), fatigue \n(59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (41%), alanine aminotransferase \nincreased (38%), platelet count decreased (37%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), \ndiarrhea (29%), hypokalemia (26%), a nd cough (20%).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma  in DESTINY- Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at leas t one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly \nor paclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to 22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5 to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anem ia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in \n2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred in one patient ea ch (0.8%).  \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decrease d \n(75%), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (72%), lymphocyte count decreased \n(70%), platelet count decreased (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), anemia (58%), aspartate \naminotransferase increased (58%), fatigue ( 55%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (54%), alanine \naminotransferase increased (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), \nblood bilirubin increased (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \n Use in Specific Populati ons \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months f ollowing the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initia tion of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause\n8 \n fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use \neffective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. \nMales : Advise male patients with female partners of r eproductive potential to use effective contraception \nduring treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU \nmay impair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHER TU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2- positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \n26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between \npatie nts ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3- 4 adverse \nreactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Of the \n125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥ 65 years and 14% were ≥ 75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. a t 1-877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n Please see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, a nd Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo in Oncology  \nThe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo is powered by our team of world- class scientists that push beyond \ntraditional thinking to create transformative medicines for people with cancer.

Results were presented as the first \nlate-breaking presentation  (#LBA1)  in the ESMO P residential S ymposium  at the European Society for \nMedical Oncology (#ESMO 21) 2021 Virtual Congress. \n \nAt a pre -specified interim analysis of DESTINY -Breast03, ENHERTU demonstrated a 72% reduction in the \nrisk of disease progression or death compared to T -DM1  (hazard ratio [ HR] = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.22- 0.37; \np=7.8x10-22). After 15.5 and 13.9 months of follow -up in the ENHERTU and T -DM1 arms respectively , the \nmedian  PFS for patients treated with ENHERTU was not reached (95% CI: 18.5- NE) compared to 6.8 \nmonths for T -DM1  (95% CI: 5.6- 8.2) as assessed by blinded independent  central  review (BI CR). In the  key \nsecondary endpoint analysis of PFS assessed by investigator s, patients treated with ENHERTU experienced  a \nthree -fold improvement in PFS of 25.1 months (95% CI: 22.1- NE) compared to 7.2 months (95% CI: 6.8-\n8.3) for T -DM1  (HR=0. 26; 95% CI: 0.20- 0.35; p=6.5x10-24). A consistent  PFS benefit was observed in  key \nsubgroups of patients treated with  ENHERTU , including those with a history of  stable brain metastases . \n \nThere was a strong trend towards improved overall survival (OS) with ENHERTU ( HR=0.56;  95% CI: 0.36-\n0.86; p=0.007172), however , this analysis is not yet mature  and is not statistically significant. N early all  \npatients treated with ENHERTU were alive at one year ( 94.1%; 95% CI: 90.3- 96.4) compared to 85.9% of \npatients treated with  T-DM1 (95% CI: 80.9- 89.7).  \n \nConfirmed objective response rate (ORR) was more than double d in the ENHERTU arm versus the T -DM1 \narm ( 79.7% ; n=208; 95% CI: 74.3- 84.4) versus 34.2% ( n=90; 95% CI: 28.5- 40.3; p<0.0001 ). Forty -two\n2 \n (16.1%) complete responses (CR) and 166 (63.6%) partial responses (PR) were observed in patients treated \nwith ENHERTU com pared to 23 (8.7%)  CRs and 67 (25.5%)  PRs in patients treated with T -DM1.  \n \nThe safety profile of the most common adverse events with ENHERTU  in DESTINY -Breast03  was \nconsistent with previous clinical trials with no new safety concerns identified. The most common grade 3 or \nhigher  drug -related  treatment emergent adverse events in the ENHERTU arm  were neutropenia (19.1%), \nthrombocytopenia (7.0 %), leukopenia (6.6%), nausea ( 6.6%) , anemia (5.8%), fatigue (5.1 %), vomiting \n(1.6%), increase in ALT (1.6%), decreased  appetite (1. 2%), increase in AST (0.8%), diarrhea ( 0.4%) and \nalopecia ( 0.4%). Overall, 10.5% of patients had confirmed interstitial lung disease (ILD)  or pneumonitis  \nrelated to treatment as determined by an independent adjudication committee . The majority of ILD events  \n(9.7%)  were primarily low grade ( grade 1 (2.7%) or grade 2 ( 7.0%)) with two  grade 3 ( 0.8%) events \nreported . No grade 4 or grade 5 ILD  or pneumonitis  events occurred.   \n \n“Patients with previously treated HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer will typically experience disease \nprogression in less than a year with available HER2 directed treatments,” said Javier Cortés, MD, PhD, \nHead, International Breast Cancer  Center (IBCC), Barcelona, Spain . “The high and consistent benefit seen \nacross efficacy endpoints and key subgroups of patients receiving ENHERTU in DESTINY -Breast03 is  \nremarkable and support s the potential of ENHERTU to become the new standard of care for those who have \npreviously been treated for HER 2 positive metastatic breast cancer.”  \n “The  early survival data, which evaluated ENHERTU against another HER2 directed ADC, show ed that \nnearly all patients  treated with ENHERTU were  alive after a year and is a positive indication of the potential \nof this medicine  to transform the treatment of HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer,” said Ken Takeshita, \nMD, Global Head, R&D , Daiichi Sankyo . “These landmark  data will form the basis of our discussions with \nglobal health authorities to potentially bring ENHERTU to patients  with previously treated HER2 positive \nmetastatic breast cancer  as a more effective treatment option as soon as possible.”  \n “Today’s results are groundbreaking ; ENHERTU tripled progression- free sur vival  as assessed by  \ninvestigators  and provided a disease control rate exceeding 95% compared to 77 % for T -DM1 in DESTINY-\nBreast03,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. \n“In addition, the safety profile w as encouraging with no grade 4 or 5 interstitial lung disease  events in this \ntrial. These unprecedented data represent a potential paradigm shift in the treatment of HER2 positive \nmetastatic breast cancer and illustrate the potential for  ENHERTU to transform more patient lives in earlier \ntreatment  settings.”   \n \nAll p atients in DESTINY -Breast03  received a t least one prior cancer therapy, including trastuzumab \n(ENHERTU = 99.6%; T -DM1 = 99.6% ), pertuzumab (ENHERTU = 62.1%; T -DM1 = 60.1%) , an a nti-\n3 \n HER2 TKI  (ENHERTU = 16.1%; T -DM1 = 13.7%) or another anti -HER2 antibody or ADC  (ENHERTU = \n0.8%; T -DM1 = 1.1 %). At the start of the trial, 23.8 % of patients  in the ENHERTU arm and 19.8% of \npatients in the T -DM1 arm  had stable brain metastases. As of data cut -off on May 21, 2021, 132  patients \nremained on treatment with ENHERTU  and 47 patients on T -DM1 . \n \nSummary of DESTINY- Breast03 Results  \n \nEfficacy Measure  \n ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg)  \n(n=261) T-DM1  (3.6 mg/kg ) \n(n=263)\n  \nMedian PFS (months) (95% CI) , per BICRi \nHR=0.28, 95% CI: 0.22 -0.37 p=7.8x10-22 NR (18.5 -NE) 6.8 months (5.6-8.2) \nLandmark 12 -month PFS (%) (95% CI) ii 75.8% (69.8 -80.7)  34.1% (27.7 -40.5)  \nMedian PFS (months) (95% CI), investigator \nassessedi \nHR=0.26, 95% CI: 0.20- 0.35 p=6.5x10-24 25.1 months (22.1 -NE) 7.2 months (6.8 -8.3) \nMedian OS (months) (95% CI)  NE NE \nLandmark 12 -month OS (%) (95% CI)  \nHR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.36- 0.86; p=0.007172iii 94.1% (90.3 -96.4)  85.9% (80.9 -89.7)  \nConfirmed ORR (%) (95% CI ; p<0.0001 )ii, iv 79.7% (74.3-84.4) 34.2% (28.5-40.3) \n     CR (%)  16.1% (n=42) 8.7% (n=23) \n     PR (%)  63.6% (n=166) 25.5% (n=67) \n     SD (%)  16.9% (n=44) 42.6% (n=112) \n     PD (%) (95% CI)  1.1% (n=3) 17.5% (n=46) \nDCRv 96.6% (n=252) 76.8% ( n=202) \nCI, confidence interval; CR, complete response;  DCR, disease control rate; NE, not estimable ; NR, not reached;  ORR, objective \nresponse rate; OS, overall survival; PD, progressive disease; PFS, progression -free survival; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease  \ni Median PFS follow -up for ENHERTU was 15.5 months (range, 15.1- 16.6) and for T -DM1 was 13.9 months (range, 11.8-15.1)  \nii As assessed by BICR  \niii Not statistically significant \niv ORR is (CR + PR)  \nv DCR is (CR+PR+SD) \n \nDESTINY- Breast01 Updated Results  \nUpdated  results from the pivotal DESTINY -Breast01  phase 2 trial were also presented at ESMO and  showed \nthat ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) continued to demonstrate impressive efficacy and durable responses in patients \nwith HER2 positive m etastatic breast cancer following two or more prior HER2 based regimens. With a \nmedian duration of follow -up of 26 .5 months, a continued increase in response was seen in patients treated \nwith ENHERTU with an updated ORR of 62.0%  (n=114; 95% CI: 54.4- 69.0) , including one additional CR  \n(7.1%) .

The primary efficacy \nendpoint of DESTINY -Breast03 is PFS based on BICR . Secondary efficacy endpoints include OS , ORR , \nDoR, clinical benefit rate , PFS  based on investigator assessment  and safety .  \n DESTINY -Breast03 enrolled 524 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe , North America, Oceania and \nSouth America . For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout DESTINY- Breast01  \nDESTINY -Breast01 is a global, single -arm, open- label, pivotal  phase  2, two- part trial evaluating the safety \nand efficacy of  ENHERTU  in patients with HER2 positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer \npreviously treated with T -DM1. The primary endpoint of the trial is ORR, as determined by independent \ncentral review. Secondary objectives include DoR, disease control rate, clinic al benefit rate, PFS , OS and \nsafety . \n \nDESTINY -Breast01 enrolled 253 patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe and North America. For more \ninformation about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer is  the most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths worldwide.1 \nMore than two million cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2020, resulting in nearly 685,000 deaths \nglobally.1 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.2 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers.3 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a \nresult of HER2 gene amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in \nbreast cancer.4 \n \nDespite initial treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane, patients wit h HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer \nwill often experience disease progression.5 More effective options are needed to further delay progression \nand extend survival .3,6,7\n5 \n  \nAbout ENHERTU ENHERTU\n® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 \ndirected ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced pr ogram in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific platform. ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in C anada, EU, Israel, Japan, UK and U.S. for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens in the metastatic setting based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is also approved in Israel, Japan and U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS f or Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see the accompanying full Prescribing Information, including B oxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide . \n About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combination with other anti cancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n ENHERTU was highlighted in the  Clinical Cancer Advances 2021  report as one of two significant \nadvancements in the “ASCO Clinical Advance of the Year: Molecular Profiling Driving Progress in GI Cancers,” based on data from both the DESTINY -Gastric01  and DESTINY -CRC01  trials, as well as one of \nthe targeted therapy advances of the year in non- small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) based on the interim results \nof the HER2  mutated cohort of the  DESTINY -Lung01 trial. \n In May 2020, ENHERTU received Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the U.S. for the treatment of \npatients with metastatic NSCLC  whose tumors have a HER2  mutation and with disease progression on or \nafter platinum- based therapy.\n6 \n About  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd)  in July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n U.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens in the metastatic setting.  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory t rial. \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen.  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for ef fective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise  patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one le vel. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticostero id treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.\n7 \n Metastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with u nresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis \noccurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 \nto 8.3).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. M edian time to \nfirst onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2  to 21.0).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU.  \nMonitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically \nindicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then mainta in dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x \n109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile \nneutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than \n1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who \nreceived ENHERTU 5.4mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was rep orted in 62% of patients. Sixteen \npercent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil \ncount was 23 days (range: 6 to 547). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% \nof patients. Fifty- one percen t had Grade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of \npatients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2- positive breast cancer who received \nENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY -Gastric01, of \nthe 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical advers e events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with \nENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF \n<50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically \nindicated. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10- 20%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease \nfrom baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not \nrecovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF \nof <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. \nPermanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure .\n8 \n Embryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise femal es of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \nat least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment w ith ENHERTU and for at least 4 \nmonths after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Gr ade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresect able or metastatic \nHER2 -positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Breast01  \nand Study DS8201- A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. \nThe median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, \ncellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of \npatients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each \n(0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical  health deterioration, pneumonia, and \nhemorrhagic shock.  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions \noccurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (79%), white \nblood cell count decreased (70%), hemoglobin decreased (70%), neutrophil count decreased (62%), fatigue \n(59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (41%), alanine aminotransferase \nincreased (38%), platelet count decreased (37%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), \ndiarrhea (29%), hypokalemia (26%), and cough (2 0%).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2- positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma  in DESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly \nor paclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5  to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, de hydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in \n2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred \nin one patient each (0.8%).\n9 \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose inter ruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decreased \n(75% ), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (72%), lymphocyte count decreased \n(70%), platelet count decreased (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), anemia (58%), aspartate \naminotransferase increased (58%), fatigue (55%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (54%), alanine \naminotransferase increased (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), \nblood bilirubin increased (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \n Use in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months followi ng the last dose of ENHERTU. \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a \nbreastfed child, a dvise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. C ontraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use \neffective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. \nMales : Advis e male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception \nduring treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU \nmay impair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatr ic Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2- positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \n26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall difference s in efficacy were observed between \npatients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3- 4 adverse \nreactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Of the \n125 patients wit h locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥ 75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 yea rs of age compared to \nyounger patients.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo in Oncology  \nThe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo is powered by our team of world- class scientists that push beyond \ntraditional thinking to create transformative medicines for people with cancer .

Results  presented \nduring a late -breaking Proffered Paper session at the  European Society for Medical Oncology ( #ESMO 21) \n2021 Virtual Congress (#LBA45 ) and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine  \nconfirm ENHERTU as the first HER2 directed therapy to show a strong tumor response in this patient \npopulation.  \n \nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer -related  death among both men and women, and accounts for \nabout one -fifth of all cancer deaths globally ,1 with approximately 80% to 85% of cases classified as \nNSCLC.2,3 There are currently no medicines approved specifically for the treatment of HER2  mutant  \nNSCLC, which affects approximately 2 % to 4% of patients with non- squamous NSCLC.4,5  \n \nPrimary results from  the HER2  mutant  cohort  (cohort 2)  of DESTINY -Lung01 in previously- treated HER2 \nmutant NSCLC demonstrated a confirmed  objective response rate ( ORR)  of 54.9% (n=50; 95% CI: 44.2 -\n65.4)  in patients  treated with  ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg)  as assessed by independent central review  (ICR) . Out \nof a total of 91 patients, one (1.1%) complete response (CR) and 49 (53.8%)  partial responses  (PR)  were \nobserved.  A confirmed disease control rate (DCR) of 92.3% (95% CI : 84.8-96.9)  was seen with a reduction \nin tumor size observed in most patients . \n \nAfter a median  follow -up of 13.1 months , the median duration of response  (DoR) for ENHERTU  was 9.3 \nmonths  (95% CI: 5.7- 14.7) . The median progression- free survival (PFS) was  8.2 months  (95% CI: 6.0- 11.9)  \nand the median o verall survival (OS)  was 17.8 months  (95% CI: 13.8 -22.1) .\n2 \n  \nResponses were observed in exploratory analys es of different  HER2  mutation subtypes, as well as in patients \nwith no detectable HER2 expression or HER2  gene ampli fication. Efficacy was observed in subgroups \nincluding prior treatment with platinum- based therapy, or platinum -based and anti -PD-(L)1 therapy, as well \nas asymp tomatic  brain metastases at baseline.  \n \nThe overall safety  profile of ENHERTU wa s consistent with previous  NSCLC trials  of ENHERTU, with no \nnew safety signals identified.  The most common grade 3 or higher drug- related treatment -emergent adverse \nevents were neutropenia (18.7%) , anemia (9.9%) , nausea ( 8.8%),  fatigue (6.6%), leukopenia (4.4%), diarrhea \n(3.3%) and vomiting (3.3%) . Twenty -three patients (25.3%) discontinued treatment due to drug- related \ntreatment -emergent adverse events. Rates of treatment -related interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis \nwere consistent with previous trials in lung cancer . There were 24 cases of ILD  or pneumonitis , as \ndetermined by an independent adjudication commit tee, with the majority (75%) low grade ( grade 1 or 2), \nfour grade 3 and two grade 5 (ILD  or pneumonitis -related death).   \n \n“Despite more than 20 years of research into HER2  mutations in non- small cell lung cancer , there are \ncurrently no approved HER2 target ed therapies for non- small cell lung cancer. Patients with HER2  mutant \nnon-small cell lung cancer are associated with younger age, female sex, never -smoking history, and a poor \nprognosis with increased incidence of brain metastases, representing an unmet m edical need,” said Bob Li, \nMD, PhD, MPH, Medical Oncologist and Principal Investigator at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center \nin New York. “The impressive results from DESTINY -Lung01 showed most patients experienced a \nreduction in tumor size with ENHERTU treatment, suggesting this medicine has the potential to become the \nnew standard of care for these patients.”  \n \n“ENHERTU is the first HER2 t arget ed therapy to demonstrate a robust and durable tumor response in \npatients with HER2  muta nt non- small cell lung cancer,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D , \nDaiichi Sankyo. “ This is potentially great news  for patients  and we are continuing to conduct research , with \nthe goal of  bringing ENHERTU to patients  with this specific form of lung cancer.”   \n \n“Lung cancer is a devastating diagnosis and f or patients with HER2  mutant lung cancer, a targeted treatment \nfor their specific disease has not been an option,”  said Susan Galbraith , MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice \nPresident, Oncology R &D, AstraZeneca. “These data reinforce the potential of  ENHERTU to become the \nfirst HER2  directed therapy for these patient s and reaffirm  how this treatment is truly delivering on its \ntransformative potential.”\n3 \n Patients in DESTINY -Lung01 were pre viously- treated with a median of two lines of therapy (range, 0- 7), \nincluding platinum -based chemotherapy (94.5%), immunotherapy (65.9%), platinum -based chemotherapy \nand immunotherapy (62.6%), docetaxel (19.8% ) and HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors  (14.3%). Of the 91 \npatients, 36.3% had asymptomatic brain metastases not requiring ongoing glucocorticoid or anticonvulsant \ntherapy  at baseline. As of data cut -off on May 3, 2021, 15 patients ( 16.5% ) remain on treatment with \nENHERTU.  \n \nSummary of HER2  mutant cohort of DESTINY -Lung01 Results \n \nEfficacy Measure (ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg)  HER2  Mutant  Total Evaluable (n= 91)i \nConfirmed ORR (%) (95% CI)ii,iii 54.9% (n=50) (44.2-65.4) \n   CR (%)  1.1% (n=1)  \n   PR (%)  53.8%  (n=49)  \n   SD (%)  37.4%  (n=34)  \nDCR  (95% CI)iv 92.3% (n=84) (84.8 -96.9)  \nMedian DoR  (months) (95% CI)  9.3 months (5.7 -14.7)  \nMedian PFS (months) (95% CI)  8.2 months (6.0 -11.9)  \nMedian OS (months) (95% CI)  17.8 months (13.8 -22.1)  \nCI, confidence interval; CR, complete response; DCR, disease control rate; DoR , duration of response; ORR, objective response rate; OS, overall \nsurvival; PFS, progression- free survival; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease \ni ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg; median follow -up was 13.1 months (range, 0.7- 29.1)  \nii As assessed by independent centr al review  \niii ORR is (CR + PR)  \niv DCR is (CR + PR +  SD) \n \nAbout DESTINY- Lung0 1 \nDESTINY- Lung01 is a global pivotal phase 2, open- label, multi- cohort trial evaluating the safety and \nefficacy of  ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg and 5.4 mg/kg) in previously- treated patients with HER2  mutant  or HER2 \noverexpressing (defined as IHC3+ or IHC2+) unresectable and/or metastatic non- squamous NSCLC.  The \nprimary endpoint is confirmed ORR by ICR. Key secondary endpoints include DoR, DCR, PFS , OS and \nsafety . \n \nAn interim analysis of ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) in the HER2 overexpressing cohort of DESTINY- Lung01  \nwas presented  at the 2020 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) hosted by the International \nAssociation for the Study of Lung Cancer  (IASLC).  \n \nDESTINY- Lung01 enr olled approximately 180 patients at multiple sites , including Asia, Europe and North \nAmerica. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov .\n4 \n About  HER2  Mutant  NSCLC            \nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women and accounts for about one -\nfifth of all cancer deaths  globally, with  80% to 85% classified as NSCLC .1,2,3 For patients with metastatic \ndisease, prognosis is particularly poor, as only approximately 6% will live beyond five years after diagnosis.2  \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth- promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors, including lung, breast, gastric and colorectal cancers. HER2  gene alterations (called HER2  \nmutations) have been identified in NSCLC as distinct molecular targets and have been reported in \napproximately 2% to 4%  of patients with  non-squamous  NSCLC.4,5 These HER2  gene mutations are \npredominantly seen in younger women, with no smoking history and have been independently associated \nwith cancer cell growth and poor prognosi s, with an increased incidence of brain metastases.4,6,7,8,9,10 \nAlthough the role of anti -HER2 treatment is well established in breast and gastric cancers, HER2 is an \nemerging biomarker in NSCLC with no approved HER2 directed therapies.4,11 \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only)  is a HER2  \ndirected ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU  is the lead \nADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific platform.  ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n \nENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Canada, EU, Israel, Japan, UK and U.S. for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior \nanti-HER2 based regimens i n the metastatic setting based on the results from the  DESTINY- Breast01  trial. \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is also approved in Israel, Japan and U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma  who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the  DESTINY- Gastric01  trial. \n ENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide .\n5 \n  \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric , lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n ENHERTU was highlighted in the  Clinical Cancer Advances 2021  report as one of two significant \nadvancements in the “ASCO Clinical Advance of the Year: Molecular Profiling Driving Progress in GI \nCancers,” based on data from both the  DESTINY- Gastric01  and DESTINY- CRC01  trials, as well as one of \nthe targeted therapy advances of the year in non- small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ), based on the interim \nresults of the HER2  mutant  cohort of the  DESTINY- Lung01 trial. \n \nIn May 2020, ENHERTU received Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the U.S. for the treatment of \npatients with metastatic non -small cell lung cancer whose tumors have a HER2  mutation and with disease \nprogression on or after platinum -based therapy.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nU.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens in the metas tatic setting.  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen.\n6 \n  \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for ef fective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor pa tients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue f or at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patient s. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis \noccurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 \nto 8.3).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY- Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to \nfirst onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2 to 21.0).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU.  Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 10\n9/L) interru pt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile \nneutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than \n1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer wh o \nreceived ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 62% of patients. Sixteen\n7 \n percent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil \ncount was 23 days (range: 6 to 547). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY- Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease i n neutrophil count was reported in 72% \nof patients. Fifty -one percent had Grade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of \npatients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who received \nENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY -Gastric01, of \nthe 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric  or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in pati ents with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF \n<50% prior to initiation of treatment.   \nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically \nindicated. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decr ease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease \nfrom baseli ne is 10- 20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not \nrecovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose.  When LVEF is <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. \nPermanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure . \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of female s of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \nat least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners  of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nThe safety  of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic \nHER2 -positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Breast01  \nand Study DS8201- A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. \nThe median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).\n8 \n  \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interst itial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, \ncellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one pati ent each \n(0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and \nhemorrhagic shock.  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse r eactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose  reductions \noccurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, wer e nausea (79%), white \nblood cell count decreased (70%), hemoglobin decreased (70%), neutrophil count decreased (62%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (41%), alanine aminotransferase \nincreased (38%), platelet count decreased (37%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), diarrhea (29%), hypokalemia (26%), and cough (20%).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma  in DESTINY- Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every 3 weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly or \npaclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to 22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5 to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurre d in \n2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred \nin one patient each (0.8%).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decreased \n(75%), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (72%), lymphocyte count decre ased \n(70%), platelet count decreased (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), anemia (58%), aspartate \naminotransferase increased (58%), fatigue (55%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (54%), alanine \naminotransferase increased (47%), diarrhea (32% ), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), \nblood bilirubin increased (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \n Use in Specific Populations\n9 \n • Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in huma n milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a \nbreastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise f emales of reproductive potential to use \neffective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. Males : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception \nduring treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU \nmay impair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2- positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \n26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in ef ficacy were observed between \npatients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3- 4 adverse \nreactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Of the \n125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥ 65 years and 14% were ≥ 75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of a ge compared to \nyounger patients.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIO NS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1- 877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Inform ation , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide.  \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo in Oncology  \nThe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo is powered by our team of world- class scientists that push beyond \ntraditional thinking to create transformative medicines for people with cancer.

    "content": "Press Release  \n \nENHERTU® Demonstrated Clinically Meaningful and Durable \nResponse in Patients with HER2 Positive Advanced Gastric Cancer in \nDESTINY -Gastric02 Phase 2 Trial  \n \n• First ENHERTU trial in Western patients with gastric cancer  \n• Efficacy and safety results consistent with pivotal DESTINY -Gastric01  trial; will support  ongoing \ndiscussions with global  health authorities  \n \nTokyo, Munich and Basking Ridge, NJ – (September  17, 2021 ) – Detailed  results from the  positive  \nDESTINY -Gastric02  phase 2 trial showed that ENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan) , the Daiichi Sankyo \nCompany, Limited ( hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) and AstraZeneca HER2  directed antibody drug conjugate \n(ADC),  provided  a clinically meaningful and durable  tumor response  in patients with HER2 positive  \nmetastatic and/or unresectable gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ)  adenocarcinoma previously treated \nwith a trastuzumab -containing regimen.  Results were presented during a late -breaking Mini Oral presentation \nat the European Society for Medical Oncology ( #ESMO 21) 2021 Virtual Congress (#LBA55).  \n \nGastric cancer is associated with a poor prognosis, particularly in  the advanced stages of the disease, with \nonly 5% to 10% of metastatic patients surviving five years  globally .1,2 Approximately o ne in five gastric \ncancers are HER2 positive .3,4 After progression on first -line HER2 targeted systemic treatment, second -line \ntreatment options in the metastatic setting are limited  in certain parts of the world , driving a need for HER2 \ntargeted therapies for these patients.1,5,6   \n \nIn the primary analysis of  DESTINY -Gastric02, the first trial of ENHERTU specifically in Western patients  \nwith HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer  or GEJ adenocarcinoma , ENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg )  \ndemonstrated a confirmed overall response rate ( ORR ) of 38.0% ( n=30; CI: 27.3 -49.6) as assessed by \nindependent central review (ICR).  Out of a total of 79 patients  treated with ENHERTU , three (3.8%) \ncomplete response s (CR) and 27 (34.2%) partial responses  (PR)  were observe d. These results were consistent \nwith those from  the pivotal DESTINY -Gastric01 phase 2 trial , previously published in The New England \nJournal of Medicine , which evaluated ENHERTU in patients from Japan and South Korea with HER2 \npositive advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who had progressed on two or more prior treatment \nregimens , including trastuzumab, a fluoropyrimidine and platinum -containing chemotherapy .7\n2 \n After a median follow -up of 5.7 months, the  median duration of response  (DoR) of ENHERTU  was 8.1 \nmonths  (95% CI: 4.1-NE). The median progression -free survival (PFS) was 5.5 months  (95% CI: 4.2-7.3). \nAn exploratory endpoint of confirmed disease control rate  (DCR) of 81% ( 95% CI : 70.6-89.0) was seen.  \n \nThe overall safety profile of ENHERTU in DESTINY -Gastric02 was consistent with that seen in DESTINY -\nGastric01. The most common grade 3 or higher drug-related treatment -emergent adverse events seen in \nDESTINY -Gastric02 were anemia (7.6%), neutropenia (7.6%), nausea (3.8%), fatigue (3.8%), vomiting \n(1.3%), diarrhea (1.3%), decreased appetite (1.3%) and decreased platelet count (1.3%). Seven  patients \n(8.9%) discontinued treatment due to drug-related treatment -emergent adverse events . There were six cases \n(7.6%) of treatment -related interstitial lung disease (ILD)  or pneumonitis  reported, as determined by an \nindependent adjudication committee . The majority (83%) were low grade (grade 1 or grade 2), with one \ngrade 5 (ILD  or pneumonitis -related death).  \n \n“While the benefit of a HER2 targeted therapy in the first -line metastatic gastric cancer setting has been well -\nestablished, the disease will eventually progress ,” said Eric Van Cutsem, MD, PhD , Full Professor and \nDivision Head of Digestive Oncology , University Hospitals Leuven,  Belgium . “The positive results of \nDESTINY -Gastric02  show a strong response rate and reinforce the establi shed efficacy and safety profile  of \nENHERTU  in patients who are in need of additional therapeutic options .” \n \n“The encouraging results from  DESTINY -Gastric02 are consistent with those previously seen in  the pivotal \nDESTINY -Gastric01 trial ,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, \nOncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “ This additional data will support  our ongoing \ndiscussions with  global  health  authorities as we work toward  ENHERTU becom ing an opti on for  patients \nwith HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer .”  \n \n“The data from DESTINY -Gastric02  reaffirm  the clinical significance  of the potential benefit of ENHERTU \nin patients with advanced gastric cancer ,” said Susan Galbraith, MD, PhD, RCP, RCR, Executive Vice \nPresident, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “Patients often experience disease progression following initial \ntherapies, and then face limited treatment options , so today’s news brings hope to both patient s and treating \nphysicians .” \n \nSummary of DESTINY -Gastric02 Results  \n \nEfficacy Measure (ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg)  Total Evaluable (n= 79)i,ii                                            \nConfirmed ORR (%) (95% CI)ii,iii 38.0% (n=30) (27.3-49.6)\n3 \n    CR (%)  3.8% (n=3)  \n   PR (%)  34.2%  (n=27)  \n   SD (%)  43.0%  (n=34)  \nDCR (95% CI)iv 81% (n=64) (70.6-89.0) \nMedian DoR (months) (95% CI)  8.1 months ( 4.1-NE) \nMedian PFS (months) (95% CI)  5.5 months ( 4.2-7.3) \nCI, confidence interval; CR, complete response; DCR, disease control rate; DoR, duration of response; ORR, objective response  rate; PFS, \nprogression -free survival; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease  \ni Assessed at 6.4 mg/kg dose  \nii As assessed by independent central review  \niii ORR is (CR + PR)  \niv DCR is (CR + PR +  SD) (exploratory endpoint)  \n \nAbout DESTINY -Gastric02  \nDESTINY -Gastric02 is an open -label, single -arm, phase 2 trial in Western patients evaluating the safety and \nefficacy of ENHERTU (6.4  mg/kg) in patients with HER2 positive  metastatic and/or unresectable gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma whose disease has progressed  on or after a trastuzumab -containing regimen.  The \nprimary endpoint of DESTINY -Gastric02 is confirmed OR R based on ICR. Secondary endpoints include \nPFS, overall survival , DoR and safety . DESTINY -Gastric02 enrolled 79 patients at multiple sites in North \nAmerica and Europe.  For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout HER2 Positive  Gastric  Cancer  \nGastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the fourth highest leading cause of \ncancer mortality , with a five -year global survival rate of 5% to 10% for advanced or metastatic disease.1,2,8  \nThere  were approximately one million new cases of gastric cancer and 768,000 deaths reported worldwide  \nin 2020.9 Incidence rates for gastric cancer are markedly higher in eastern Asia, where approximately half of \nall cases occur .1,8,9,10 Gastric cancer is typically diagnosed in the advanced stage but even when diagnosed in \nearlier stages of the disease the survival rate remains modest .5,11,12 \n \nApproximately one in five gastric cancers are HER2 positive.3,4 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -\npromoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including breast, gastric, lung and \ncolorectal cancers .4 HER2 overexpression may be associated with a specific HER2 gene alteration known as \nHER2 amplification .4  \n \nRecommended first -line treatment for HER2 p ositive advanced or metastatic gastric cancer is combination \nchemotherapy plus trastuzumab, an anti -HER2 medicine, which has been shown to improve survival \noutcomes when added to chemotherapy.10  For patients with metastatic gastric cancer that progress fo llowing \ninitial treatment with a trastuzumab -based regimen, treatment options are limited, and in many regions in the \nworld there are no additional HER2 directed medicines available.1,5,6\n4 \n  \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only)  is a HER2  \ndirected ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU  is the lead \nADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC  \nscientific platform.  ENHERTU  consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to  a topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payload , an exatecan derivative, via  a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Canada, EU, Israel, Japan, UK and U.S. for  the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior \nanti-HER2 based regimens in the metastatic setting based on the results from the  DESTINY -Breast01  trial. \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is also approved in Israel, Japan and U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma  who have received a prior \ntrastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the  DESTINY -Gastric01  trial. \n \nENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo -Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide .  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development progra m is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric , lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n \nENHERTU was highlighted in the  Clinical Cancer Advances 2021  report as one of two significant \nadvancements in the “ASCO Clinical Advance of the Year: Molecular Profiling Driving Progress in GI \nCancers,” based on data from both the  DESTINY -Gastric01  and DESTINY -CRC01  trials, as well as one of \nthe targeted therapy advances of the year in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ), based on the interim \nresults of the HER2  muta nt cohort of the  DESTINY -Lung01  trial.\n5 \n In May 2020, ENHERTU  received Breakthrough Therapy Designation  in the U.S. for the treatment of \npatients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a HER2  mutation and with disease progression on or \nafter platinum -based therapy.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019  and datopotamab  deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020 , except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for manufacturing \nand supply of ENHERTU and datopo tamab deruxtecan.  \n \nU.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens in the metastatic setting.  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be cont ingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen.  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms , including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindi cations  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life -threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise patients to immediately report cou gh, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate\n6 \n evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of on set, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis \noccurred in  2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 \nto 8.3).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125  patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to \nfirst onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2  to 21.0).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU.  \nMonitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically \nindicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil C ount [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x \n109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile \nneutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than \n1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic H ER2-positive breast cancer who \nreceived ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 62% of patients. Sixteen \npercent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil \ncount was 23 days ( range: 6 to 547). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125  patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with EN HERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% \nof patients. Fifty -one percent had Grade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of \npatients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, in cluding \nENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who received \nENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY -Gastric01, of \nthe 125  patients with locally advanced or metastat ic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU  6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with\n7 \n ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF \n<50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically \nindicated.  When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease \nfrom baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not \nrecovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within \n10% from baseline, resume trea tment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF \nof <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue  ENHERTU. \nPermanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure . \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity  \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregna ncy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \nat least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 \nmonths after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <5 0 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic \nHER2 -positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Breast01  \nand Study DS8201 -A-J101 . ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. \nThe median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, \ncellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of \npatients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and  the following events occurred in one patient each \n(0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and \nhemorrhagic shock.  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted f or 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract  infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions \noccurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reaction s, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (79%), white \nblood cell count decreased (70%), hemoglobin decreased (70%), neutrophil count decreased (62%), fatigue\n8 \n (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (41%), alani ne aminotransferase \nincreased (38%), platelet count decreased (37%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), \ndiarrhea (29%), hypokalemia (26%), and cough (20%).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was ev aluated in 187  patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma  in DESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4  mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly \nor paclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6  months (range: \n0.7 to 22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8  months (range: 0.5  to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \n \nSerious adverse re actions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities  due to adverse reactions occurred in \n2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred \nin one patient each (0.8%).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted  for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocyt openia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decreased \n(75%), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (72%), lymphocy te count decreased \n(70%), platelet count decreased (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), anemia (58%), aspartate \naminotransferase increased (58%), fatigue (55%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (54%), alanine \naminotransferase increased (47%),  diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), \nblood bilirubin increased (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \n \nUse in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise p atients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of E NHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a \nbreastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing : Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant w oman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use \neffective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. \nMales : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contr aception \nduring treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU \nmay impair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2 -positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \n26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in ef ficacy were observed between \npatients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse\n9 \n reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Of the \n125 patients with local ly advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of a ge compared to \nyounger patients.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or  \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA -1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.  \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo in Oncology  \nThe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo is powered by our team of world -class scientists that push beyond \ntraditional thinking to create transformative medicines for people with cancer.

    "content": "Press Release  \n \nDESTINY- Gastric 06 Phase 2 Trial of ENHERTU® Initiated in China \nin Patients with HER2  Positive Advanced Gastric Cancer  \n \nTokyo, Munich and Basking Ridge, NJ –  (September  16, 2021)  – Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited \n(hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) and AstraZeneca today announced that the first patient was dosed in  DESTINY -\nGastric06 , a phase 2 trial in China evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU® (trastuzumab \nderuxtecan)  in patients with HER2 positive  locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal \njunction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma previously treated with at least two prior regimens including a \nfluoropyrimidine and a  platinum agent.  \n \nApproximately half of all  worldwide cases of gastric cancer occur in China,1,2 with a bout 80% of patients \npresenti ng with adva nced disease at the time of diagnosis.3 For patients with HER2 positive metastatic \ngastric cancer in China, there are limited HER2 directed therapies available following disease progression \nwith a trastuzumab -containing regimen, and more options are needed to address this continued unmet need.4  \n “Initiation of the DESTINY -Gastric06 trial is an important step in the clinical development of ENHERTU  in \nChina for the treatment of  patients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer ,” said Gilles Gallant, \nBPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, G lobal Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi \nSankyo. “Given the impressive results seen in other studies of ENHERTU  in this setting , we anticipate this \nstudy will further support our efforts to bring an important HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate to \npatients and the medical community  in China.”  \n About DESTINY- Gastric0 6 \nDESTINY -Gastric0 6 is an open- label , single -arm p hase 2 trial in China  evaluating the safety and efficacy  of \nENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) in patients with HER2  positive  locally advanced or metastatic  gastric or GEJ \nadenocarcinoma previously treated with at least two prior regimens including a fluoropyrimidine and a \nplatinum agent.  \n \nThe primary endpoint  of DESTINY -Gastric0 6 is confirmed objective response rate (ORR) . Secon dary \nendpoints include  investigator assessed  ORR , progression- free survival, duration of response, disease control \nrate, overall survival, pharmacokinetics,  immunogenicity and safety.\n2 \n DESTINY -Gastric0 6 will enroll a pproximately 75 patients  at multiple sites  in China . For more information \nabout the trial, visit clinicaltrials.gov . \n \nAbout HER2 Positive  Gastric  Cancer \nGastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the fourth highest leading cause of \ncancer mortality .5 There  were approximately one million new cases of gastric cancer and 768,000 deaths \nreported worldwide  in 2020 .5 Gastric cancer is typically diagnosed in the advanced stage but even when \ndiagnosed in earlier stages of the disease the survival rate remains modest ,6,7,8 with a five -year survival rate \nof 5% to 10% for advanced or metastatic disease.9 \n \nIncidence rates for gastric cancer are markedly higher in eastern Asia, particularly in China, where \napproximately half of all worldwide cases occur .2,5 Gastric cancer is the third most common cancer in China \nwith about  478,000 new cases and is the third leading cause of cancer -related death  with approximately \n374,000 deaths in 2020.2 Approximately 80% of patients present with advanced disease at the time of \ndiagnosis  in China .3 \n \nApproximately one in five gastric cancers are considered HER2 positive.10,11 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase \nreceptor growth- promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including breast, \ngastric, lung and colorectal cancers.11 HER2 overexpression may be associated with a specific HER2 gene \nalteration known as HER2 amplification.11 \n \nRecommended first -line treatment  for HER2 positive advanced or metastatic gastric cancer in China is \ncombination chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, an anti -HER2 medicine, which has been shown to improve \nsurvival outcomes when added to chemotherapy .1 For patients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer \nin China, there are limited HER2 directed therapies available following disease progression with a \ntrastuzumab -containing regimen, and more options are needed to address this continued unmet  need .4 \n About ENHERTU ENHERTU\n® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 \ndirected antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC \ntechnology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced \nprogram in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.  ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody \nattached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide- based \ncleavable linker.\n3 \n  \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Canada, EU, Israel, Japan, UK and U.S.  for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior \nanti-HER2 based regimens in the metastatic setting based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is also approved in Israel,  Japan  and U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma  who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial. \n \nENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication Guide .  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including b reast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n ENHERTU was highlighted in the  Clinical Cancer Advances 2021  report as one of two significant \nadvancements in the “ASCO Clinical Advance of the Year: Molecular Profiling Driving Pr ogress in GI \nCancers,” based on data from both the DESTINY -CRC01  and DESTINY -Gastric01  trials, as well as one of \nthe targeted therapy advances of the year in non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), based on the interim \nresults of the HER2 mutated cohor t of the  DESTINY -Lung01 trial.  \n \nIn May 2020, ENHERTU  received Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the U.S. for the treatment of \npatients with metastatic NSCLC  whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and with disease progression on or \nafter platinum- based therapy. \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019, and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in  July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for manufacturing \nand supply of ENHERTU and dat opotamab deruxtecan.\n4 \n U.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens in the metastatic setting.  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory t rial. \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen.  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindicatio ns \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor pa tients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue f or at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patient s. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis \noccurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 \nto 8.3).\n5 \n Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to \nfirst onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2  to 21.0).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU.  \nMonitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically \nindicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil C ount [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x \n109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile \nneutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than \n1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who \nreceived ENHERTU 5.4mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 62% of patients. Sixteen \npercent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil \ncount wa s 23 days (range: 6 to 547). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma trea ted with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% \nof patients. Fifty- one percent had Grade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutr openia was reported in 4.8% of \npatients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 th erapies, including \nENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2- positive breast cancer who received \nENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY -Gastric01, of \nthe 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with \nENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF \n<50% prior to initiation of treatment.   \nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically \nindicated. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10- 20%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease \nfrom baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not \nrecovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within \n10% from baseline, resume treat ment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF \nof <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. \nPermanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure . \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential\n6 \n risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive poten tial to use effective contraception during treatment and for \nat least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at l east 4 \nmonths after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia ( platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Breast01  \nand Study DS8201- A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. \nThe median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, \ncellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of \npatients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each \n(0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deter ioration, pneumonia, and \nhemorrhagic shock.  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reac tions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions \noccurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse r eactions (>2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (79%), white \nblood cell count decreased (70%), hemoglobin decreased (70%), neutr ophil count decreased (62%), fatigue \n(59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (41%), alanine aminotransferase increased (38%), platelet count decreased (37%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), \ndiarrhea (29%), hypokalemia (26%), and cough (20%).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2- positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma  in DESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly \nor paclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5  to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in \n2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pn eumonia occurred \nin one patient each (0.8%).\n7 \n  \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnor malities, were hemoglobin decreased \n(75%), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (72%), lymphocyte count decreased \n(70%), platelet count decreased (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), anemia (58%), aspartate \naminotran sferase increased (58%), fatigue (55%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (54%), alanine \naminotransferase increased (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), blood bilirubin increased (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopeci a (22%).  \n \nUse in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious a dverse reactions in a \nbreastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contracepti on during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. \nMales : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception \nduring treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU \nmay impair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2- positive breast cancer  treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \n26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3- 4 adverse \nreactions observed  in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Of the \n125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% wer e ≥75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or  \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo in Oncology\n8 \n The oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo is powered by our team of world- class scientists that push beyond \ntraditional thinking to create transformative medicines for people with cancer.

The safety profile \nof ENHERTU  was consistent with previous clinical trials with no new safety concerns  identified  and no \ngrade 4 or 5 treatment -related interstitial lung disease events .  \n “DESTINY -Breast 03 is the first global phase 3 head- to-head trial of ENHERTU  against  an act ive control \nand support s the potential of this medicine to become the new standard of care for patients with  HER2 \npositive metastatic breast cancer  following treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane ,” said Ken Takeshita, \nMD, Global Head, Research and Development, Daiichi Sankyo. “ We believe this specifically engineered\n2 \n ADC , with a highly  sophisticated delivery system , is fulfilling  its promise  to reshape the treatment of HER2 \npositive metastatic breast cancer  with the goal  to move into earlier lines of treatment for HER2 positive \nbreast cancer , as well as many other HER2 expressing tumor types  across our broad clinical trial program .” \n \n“There is a continued need for new options  and better outcomes  for patients with HER2 positive metastatic \nbreast cancer  who often experience disease progression after  initial treatment with available standards of \ncare,” said  Susan Galbraith,  MBBChir, PhD , Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D , AstraZeneca.  \n“These transformative progression -free survival results demonstrate the superiority of ENHERTU compared \nto T-DM1  and the encouraging safety data may open future opportunities to bring this benefit to patients in \nearlier treatment  settings .”   \n \nThese data will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and shared with health authorities.  \n \nAbout DESTINY- Breast03   \nDESTINY -Breast03  is a global, head -to-head, randomized, open- label , pivotal  phase 3 trial evaluating  the \nsafety and efficacy of ENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg ) versus T -DM1 in patients with HER2 positive unresectable \nand/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and  a taxane.  \n The primary efficacy endpoint of DESTINY -Breast03 is PFS based on b linded independent central review. \nSecondary efficacy endpoints include OS , objective response rate  (ORR) , duration of response  (DOR), \nclinical benefit rate , PFS based on investigator assessment  and safety .  \n DESTINY -Breast03 enrolled approx imately 500  patients at multiple sites in Asia, Europe , North America, \nOceania and South America . For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Breast Ca ncer \nBreast cancer remains the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths in \nwomen worldwide .1 More than two million cases of breast cancer were  diagnosed in 2020 , resulting in nearly \n685,000 deaths  globally.1 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 positive.2  \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers.6 HER2 protein overexpression may occur as a \nresult of HER2 gene amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in \nbreast cancer .7\n3 \n Despite initial treatment with trastuzumab and a taxane, patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer  \nwill often  experience disease  progress ion. More effective options are needed to further delay progression and \nextend survival .4,5,Error! Bookmark not defined.  \n \nAbout ENHERTU \nENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab der uxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2  \ndirected ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific platform.  ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I \ninhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide -based cleavable linker.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Canada, EU, Israel, Japan, UK  and U.S. for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior \nanti-HER2 based regimens in the metastatic setting based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is also approved in Israel, Japan  and U.S. f or the treatment of adult patients with \nlocally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma  who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial. \n \nENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see the accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide .  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Progra m \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combination with other anti cancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n \nENHERTU was highlighted in the  Clinical Cancer Advances 2021  report as one of two significant \nadvancements in the “ASCO Cl inical Advance of the Year: Molecular Profiling Driving Progress in GI \nCancers,” based on data from both the DESTINY -CRC01  and DESTINY -Gastric01  trials, as well as one of \nthe targeted therapy advances of the year in non- small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC)  based on the interim results \nof the HER2 mutated cohort of the  DESTINY -Lung01 trial. \n \nIn May 2020, ENHERTU received Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC  whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and with disease progression on or \nafter platinum- based therapy.\n4 \n  \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd)  in July 2020, except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the \nmanufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nU.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens in the metastatic setting.  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmat ory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen.  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (I LD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all pa tients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor pa tients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue f or at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.\n5 \n  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patient s. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis \noccurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 \nto 8.3).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to \nfirst onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2  to 21.0).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile n eutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU.  \nMonitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically \nindicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interru pt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x \n109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile \nneutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or  a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than \n1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who \nreceived ENHERTU 5.4mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 62% of patients. Sixteen \npercent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil \ncount was 23 days (range: 6 to 547). Febrile neutro penia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in n eutrophil count was reported in 72% \nof patients. Fifty- one percent had Grade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of \npatients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. In the 234 pati ents with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who received \nENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY -Gastric01, of \nthe 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with \nENHERTU has not been studied in patients wit h a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF \n<50% prior to initiation of treatment.   \nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically \nindicated. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease fro m baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease \nfrom baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not \nrecovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within \n10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LV EF is <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF \nof <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. \nPermanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.\n6 \n  \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \nat least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 \nmonths after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nThe saf ety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic \nHER2 -positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Breast01  \nand Study DS8201- A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intra venous infusion once every three weeks. \nThe median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were inte rstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, \ncellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of \npatients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each \n(0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and \nhemorrhagic shock.  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to advers e reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. D ose reductions \noccurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (79%), white \nblood cell count decreased (70%), hemoglobin decreased (70%), neutrophil count decreased (62%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (41%), alanine aminotransferase \nincreased (38%), pl atelet count decreased (37%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), \ndiarrhea (29%), hypokalemia (26%), and cough (20%).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma  in DESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly \nor paclitaxel  (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5  to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in \n2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred \nin one patient each (0.8%).\n7 \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adve rse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, leukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, an d febrile neutropenia.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decreased \n(75%), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (72%), lymphocyte count decreased \n(70%), platelet coun t decreased (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), anemia (58%), aspartate \naminotransferase increased (58%), fatigue (55%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (54%), alanine \naminotransferase increased (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vom iting (26%), constipation (24%), \nblood bilirubin increased (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \n \nUse in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the l ast dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a \nbreastfed child, advise wo men not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use \neffective contracepti on during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. \nMales : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception \nduring treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU \nmay impair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2- positive breast cancer  treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \n26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between \npatients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3- 4 adverse \nreactions observed  in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Of the \n125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% wer e ≥75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monito r for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide . \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo in Oncology  \nThe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo is powered by our team of world- class scientists that push beyond \ntraditional thinking to create transformative medicines for people with cancer.

    "content": "Press Release  \n \nDESTINY -Gastric 04 Head -to-Head Phase 3 Trial of ENHERTU® \nInitiated in Patients with HER2  Positive Advanced Gastric Cancer   \n \nTokyo, Munich and Basking Ridge, NJ – (July 8, 2021)  – Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, \nDaiichi Sankyo) and AstraZeneca today announced that the first patient was dosed in  DESTINY -Gastric04 , a \nglobal phase 3 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan) compared to \nramucirumab/paclitaxel combination therapy in patients with HER2 positive  metastatic and/or unresectable \ngastric or gastro esophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma with disease progression  on or after a \ntrastuzumab -containing regimen.  \n \nGastric cancer is associated with a poor prognosis, particularly in the advanced stages  of the disease , with \nonly 5% to 10% of patients surviving 5 years.1 One in five gastric cancers are  considered HER2 positive,2,3 \nhowever loss of HER2 expression has been observed in 29% to 69% of patients with gastric cancer following \ntreatment with trastuzumab , suggesting a decrease in HER2 expression can result in progression on \ntrastuzumab  and may be associated with poor outcomes .4,5,6,7,8 After progression on first -line HER2  targeted \nsystemic treatment , second -line treatment options are limited , driving a need for new HER2 targeted \ntherapies for these patients .1,7,8    \n \n“In the DESTINY -Gastric04 phase 3 trial, we are evaluating whether ENHERTU will improve survival as \ncompared to another commonly used combination therapy regimen in the second -line HER2 positive \nmetastatic gastric cancer setting,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global \nHead, Oncology Develop ment, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “Results from our earlier research have led \nto approvals of ENHERTU in two regions for patients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer and we \nare excited to continue our research in this patient population to furth er support our efforts to bring a new \ntreatment option to more patients around the world.”  \n \nAbout DESTINY -Gastric04  \nDESTINY -Gastric04  is a global , randomized, open -label, head-to-head phase 3 trial evaluating the safety \nand efficacy  of ENHERTU  (6.4mg/kg) compared to ramucirumab /paclitaxel  combination therapy  in patients \nwith HER2  positive  metastatic  and/or unresectable  gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma with disease progression  \non or after a trastuzumab -containing regimen.\n2 \n Patients  will be randomized  to receive either ENHERTU or ramucirumab /paclitaxe l. The primary endpoint  \nof DESTINY -Gastric04  is overall survival.  Secondary endpoints include  investigator assessed  progression -\nfree survival, objective response rate, duration of response, disease control rate , safety , pharmacokinetics and \nimmunogenicity .  \n \nDESTINY -Gastric04  will enrol l approximately 490 patients  at multiple sites in Asia, Europe  and South \nAmerica . For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n \nAbout HER2 Positive  Gastric  Cancer  \nGastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the fourth highest leading cause of \ncancer mortality , with a five year survival rate of 5% to 10% for advanced or metastatic disease .1,9 There  \nwere approximately one million new cases of gastric cancer and 768,000 deaths reported worldwide  in \n2020 .10 Incidence rates for gastric cancer are markedly higher in eastern Asia, where approximately half of \nall cases occur .1,10,11 Gastric cancer is typically diagnosed in the advanced stage but even when diagnosed in \nearlier stages of the disease the survival rate remains modest .4,12,13  \n \nApproximately one in five gastric cancers are considered HER2 positive.2,3 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase \nreceptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including breast, \ngastric, lung and colorectal cancers.3 HER2 overexpression may be associated with a specific HER2 gene \nalteration known as HER2 amplification.3  \n \nRecommended first -line treatment for HER2 positive advanced or metastatic gastric cancer is combination \nchemotherapy plus trastuzumab, an anti -HER2 medicine, which has been shown to improve survival \noutcomes when added to chemotherapy.11 However, loss of HER2 expression has been observed in 29% to \n69% of patients with gastric cancer following treatment with trastuzumab , suggesting a decrease in HER2 \nexpression can result in progression on trastuzumab and may be associated with poor outcome s in gastric \ncancer . 4,5,6 ,7,8 For patients with metastatic gastric cancer that progresses following initial treatment with a \ntrastuzumab -based regimen, treatment options are limited , and in many  regions in the world there are no \nadditional HER2 directed medicines available . 1,7,8  \n \nAbout ENHERTU  \nENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 \ndirected antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC \ntechnology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced\n3 \n program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.  ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody \nattached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload , an exatecan derivative, via  a stable tetrapeptide -based \ncleavable linker.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Canada, EU, Japan, UK and in the U.S., for  the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior \nanti-HER2 based regimens in the metastatic setting based on the results from the  DESTINY -Breast01  trial. \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is also approved in the U.S. and Japan  for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma  who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the  DESTINY -Gastric01  trial. \n \nENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo -Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide .  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric , lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combinat ion with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n \nENHERTU was recently highlighted in the Clinical Cancer Adv ances 2021  report as one of two significant \nadvancements in the “ASCO Clinical Advance of the Year: Molecular Profiling Driving Progress in GI \nCancers,” based on data from both the DESTINY -CRC 01 and DESTINY -Gastric01  trials.   \n \nIn May 2020, ENHERTU  received Breakthrough Therapy Designation  (BTD) in the U.S. for the treatment of \npatients with metastatic non -small cell lung cancer whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and with di sease \nprogression on or after platinum -based therapy.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019 , and datopotamab  deruxtecan (Dato -DXd) in July 2020 , except in Japan where \nDaiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for manufacturing \nand supply of ENHERTU and dat opotamab deruxtecan.\n4 \n  \nU.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens in the metas tatic setting.  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory t rial. \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen.  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo -fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for ef fective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life -threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise  patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Con sider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one le vel. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticostero id treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with u nresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis \noccurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 \nto 8.3).\n5 \n  \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125  patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. M edian time to \nfirst onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2  to 21.0).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU.  \nMonitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically \nindicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil C ount [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x \n109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile \nneutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than \n1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who \nreceived ENHERTU 5.4mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 62% of patients. Sixteen \npercent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil \ncount wa s 23 days (range: 6 to 547). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125  patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma trea ted with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% \nof patients. Fifty -one percent had Grade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutr openia was reported in 4.8% of \npatients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 th erapies, including \nENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who received \nENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY -Gastric01, of \nthe 125  patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU  6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with \nENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF \n<50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically \nindicated. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease \nfrom baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not \nrecovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within \n10% from baseline, resume treat ment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF \nof <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. \nPermanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure .\n6 \n Embryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \nat least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male pat ients with female partners of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 \nmonths after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platel ets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastati c Breast Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic \nHER2 -positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Breast01  \nand Study DS8201 -A-J101 . ENHERTU wa s administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. \nThe median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who rec eived ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, \ncellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of \npatients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following e vents occurred in one patient each \n(0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and \nhemorrhagic shock.  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fati gue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions \noccurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (79%), white \nblood cell count decreased (70%), hemoglobin decreased (70%), neutrophil count decreased (62%), fatigue \n(59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (41%), alanine aminotransferase \nincreased (38%), platelet count decreased (37%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), \ndiarrhea (29%), hypokalemia (26%), and cough (20%).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187  patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma  in DESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4  mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinoteca n (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly \nor paclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6  months (range: \n0.7 to 22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8  months (range: 0.5  to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fataliti es due to adverse reactions occurred in\n7 \n 2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred \nin one patient each (0.8%).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD account ed for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thromboc ytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia , decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decreased \n(75%), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (72%), lympho cyte count decreased \n(70%), platelet count decreased (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), anemia (58%), aspartate \naminotransferase increased (58%), fatigue (55%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (54%), alanine \naminotransferase increased (47% ), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), \nblood bilirubin increased (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \n \nUse in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise  patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of  ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a \nbreastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing : Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception : Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant  woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use \neffective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. \nMales : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective con traception \nduring treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU \nmay impair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2 -positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \n26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between \npatients ≥65 years of age compared to younger p atients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse \nreactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Of the \n125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treate d \nwith ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to \nyounger patients.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or  \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA -1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide .\n8 \n About Daiichi Sankyo in Oncology  \nThe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo is powered by our team of world -class scientists that push beyond \ntraditional thinking to create transformative medicines for people with cancer.

    "content": "Press Release  \n \nDESTINY- Breast09  Head -to-Head First -Line Phase 3 Trial of \nENHERTU® Initiated in Patients with HER2 Positive Metastatic  \nBreast Cancer  \n  \nTokyo, Munich and Basking Ridge, NJ –  (June 14, 2021)  – Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, \nDaiichi Sankyo) and AstraZeneca today announced that the first patient was dosed in DESTINY -Breast09 , a \nglobal head -to-head phase 3 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan)  \nwith or without pertuzumab  compared to standard of care ( THP: taxane, trastuzumab and pertuzumab)  as a \npotential first-line treatment in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.  This  is the first  trial to \nevaluate ENHERTU in the first-line metastatic setting in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer.  \n \nMany patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer have aggressive disease due to progression from \nan earlier stage, with  a significant proportion having  their disease relapse after receiving THP or other \nstandard anti -HER2 therapies in an adjuvant setting.1 Research has also shown that patients often progress in \nless than two years following initial treatment for HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer .1 While there have \nbeen substantial advances in the treatment of these patients, there remains an ongoing need to improve \noutcomes, and as a result m ore effective HER2 directed treatments and novel combination regimens are \nneeded.1,2 \n \n“The re have been no significant advances in first -line metastatic breast cancer treatment in nearly a decade, \nand most patients still progress on the the current standard of care THP regimen , highlighting the need for \nmore effective HER2 directed treatments and novel combination regimens, ” said Gilles Gallant,  BPharm, \nPhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “Based on the encouraging results we are seeing  in patients who have received prior treatment for  HER2 \npositive metastatic breast cancer, we have initiated DESTINY -Breast09  to evaluate whether  earlier use of \nENHERTU  alone or as part of a novel combination regimen may help improve outcomes  for patients in the  \nfirst-line metastatic setting  as compared to the current standard of care.”  \n About DESTINY- Breast09  \nDESTINY -Breast09 is a\n global head- to-head phase 3 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU \n(5.4 mg/kg)  with or without pertuzumab compared to standard of care ( THP: taxane [docetaxel or  paclitaxel] , \ntrastuzumab and pertuzumab) as a first -line treatment in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.\n2 \n Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either  ENHERTU  as a monotherapy with a pertuzumab- matching \nplacebo; EN HERTU in comb ination with pertuzumab ; or, current  THP standard of care (a taxane [docetaxel \nor paclitaxel], trastuzumab and pertuzumab) . Randomization will be stratified by prior treatment ( de novo \nversus recurrent  with de novo  capped at 50% ), hormone receptor ( HR) status and PIK 3CA mutation status . \n \nThe primary endpoint of DESTINY -Breast09 i s progression -free survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded \nindependent central review . Secondary endpoints include investigator -assessed PFS ; overall survival  (OS) ; \nobjective response rate ; duration of response ; time to second progression  or death ; health -related quality of \nlife (QoL);  time to deterioration  of physical and role function, global health status/QoL and pain scores;  \ngeneration of antibodies  against ENHERTU or pertuzumab ; immunogenicity ; pharmacokinetics ; and safety.  \n \nDESTINY -Breast09 will  enroll  approximately 1,134 patients at multiple sites in Africa , Asia , Europe, North \nAmerica,  Oceania and South America . For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov .  \n \nAbout HER2 Positive Breast Cancer  \nBreast cancer remains the most common cancer and is one of the leading causes of cancer -related deaths in \nwomen worldwide.3 More than two million cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year, resulting in nearly \n685,000 deaths  globally.3 \n \nHER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth- promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. HER2 overexpression may be associated with a \nspecific HER2 gene alteration known as HER2 amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease \nand poor prognosis in breast cancer.4 Approximately one in five cases of breast cancer are considered HER2 \npositive.5  \n \nIn the first -line HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer setting, approximately 50% of cases are considered de \nnovo, meaning the disease is metastatic from initial diagnosi s, while the remaining cases occur due to disease \nprogression from early stage disease.1 While research has shown that patients with recurrent disease have \nworse clinical outcomes than patients with de novo metastatic disease, patients diagnosed with de novo \nmetastatic disease also  often progress in less than two years .1 The current standard of care for patients with \nfirst-line metastatic breast cancer is the THP regimen , which was approved nearly a decade ago.1,6 More \neffective HER2 directed treatments and novel combination regimens are needed for patients with first -line \nHER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.1,2\n3 \n About ENHERTU \nENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2  directed \nantibody drug conjugate (ADC). Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, \nENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in \nAstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in Canada, EU, Japan, UK and the U.S ., for the treatment of adult \npatients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior \nanti-HER2 -based regimens in the metastatic setting based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is also approved in the U.S. and Japan  for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma  who have \nreceived a prior tr astuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the  DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see the accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide .  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including b reast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. \nTrials in combination with other anti cancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n \nENHERTU was highlighted in the Clinical Cancer Advances 2021  report as one of two significant \nadvancements in the “ASCO Clinical Advance of the Year: Molecular Profiling Driving Progress in GI \nCancers,” based on data from both the  DESTINY -CRC01  and DESTINY -Gastric01  trials, as well as one of \nthe targeted therapy advances of the year in NSCLC, based on the interim results of the HER2 mutated cohort \nof the  DESTINY -Lung01 trial.  In May 2020, ENHERTU received Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) \nin the U.S. for the treatment of patients with metastatic non -small cell lung cancer whose tumors have a \nHER2 mutation and with disease progression on or after platinum -based therapy.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \nENHERTU in March 2019, and datopotamab deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd)  in July 2020, except in Japan where\n4 \n Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing \nand supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan. \n U.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens in the metastatic setting.  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory t rial. \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen.  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently d iscontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately \nreport symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for ef fective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor pa tients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a \npulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, \nthen if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue f or at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patients . Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis\n5 \n occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to \n8.3). \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with l ocally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ \nadenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2 to 21.0).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile ne utropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU.  \nMonitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically \nindicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrup t \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x \n109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile \nneutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 \nhour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who \nreceived ENHERTU 5.4mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 62% of patients. Sixteen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil \ncount was 23 days (range: 6 to 547). Febrile neutro penia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ \nadenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of \npatients. Fifty -one percent had Grade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of \npatients.  \n Left Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. In the 234 pat ients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who received \nENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY -Gastric01, of the \n125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU  6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with \nENHERTU has not been studied in patients wi th a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF \n<50% prior to initiation of treatment.   \nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. \nWhen LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease fr om baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. \nWhen LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU \nand repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is \n10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to \nwithin 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When L VEF is <40% or absolute decrease \nfrom baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% \nor absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU i n patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure .\n6 \n Embryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \nat least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 \nmonths after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n Additional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 10\n9/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nThe safety of E NHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic \nHER2 -positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Breast01  \nand Study DS8201- A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous i nfusion once every three weeks. \nThe median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial  lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, \ncellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of \npatients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient e ach \n(0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reacti ons occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, \nleukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of \npatients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction \nwere fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (79%), white \nblood cell count decreased (70%), hemoglobin decreased (70%), neutrophil count decreased (62%), fatigue \n(59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (41%), alanine aminotransferase increased (38%), platelet count decreased (37%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), \ndiarrhea (29%), hypokalemia (26%), and cough (20%).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2- positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma  in DESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekl y \nor paclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5  to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reaction s occurred in\n7 \n 2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred in \none patient each (0.8%).  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterrupti ons due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fati gue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decreased \n(75%), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (72%), lymphocyte count decreased \n(70%) , platelet count decreased (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), anemia (58%), aspartate \naminotransferase increased (58%), fatigue (55%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (54%), alanine aminotransferase increased (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokal emia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), \nblood bilirubin increased (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \n Use in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential  risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if \na patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the \nlast dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause fetal \nharm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective \ncontraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. Males : \nAdvise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception duri ng \ntreatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU may \nimpair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geria tric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2- positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \n26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between \npatients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3 -4 adverse \nreactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Of the \n125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with \nENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥ 75 years. No overall \ndifferences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger \npatients.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic imp airment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1 -877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medw atch.   \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide .\n8 \n About Daiichi Sankyo in Oncology  \nThe oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo is powered by our team of world- class scientists that push beyond \ntraditional thinking to create transformative medicines for people with cancer.

Five  \nconfirmed  complete or partial  response s (CR/PR s) were seen , with four additional CR/PRs awaiting \nconfirmation  at the time of data cut -off of January 8, 2021. A disease control rate of 95%  was observed.   \n “There are currently  limited treatment options  for patients with previously treated metastatic t riple negative \nbreast cancer , historically a very difficult -to-treat subtype of breast cancer ,” said Aditya Bardia, MD, MPH, \nDirector of Breast Cancer Research, Mass General Cancer Center , Harvard Medical School. “The se initial  \nsafety and efficacy  results of datopotamab deruxtecan in patients with triple negative breast cancer are \nencouraging and warrant further development for patients with breast cancer .”  \n \nThe safety profile of datopotamab deruxtecan seen in the TNBC  cohort  is consistent with safety that has  been \npreviously reported in the non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohort of TROPION- PanTumor01. No\n2 \n patients discontinued treatment  due to adverse events ( AEs); however, dose reductions  due to AEs occurred \nin six patients  (25%) and were most commonly due to stomatitis (13%) and mucosal inflammation (8%) . \nGrade 3 or higher  treatment emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) regardless of causality occurred in 33 % of \npatients. TEAEs  grade 3 or higher  included stomatitis (13 %), fatigue (4% ) and anemia (4%)  with  no g rade 3 \nor higher TEAEs of diarrhea or neutropenia. The most common TEAEs overall in ≥ 25% of patients were  \nstomatitis, nausea, fatigue , vomiting, and alopecia. No cases adjudicated as drug -related interstitial lung \ndisease (ILD) were observed. \n \n“These preliminary results provide proof -of-concept that targeting TROP2 with datopotamab deruxtecan may \nbe an effective treatment strategy for patients with previously treated metastatic triple negative breast \ncancer ,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, Oncology \nDevelopment, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sanky o. “We are encouraged by the early tumor responses and \ndisease control seen in these patients and we will continue to explore the potential of datopotamab \nderuxtecan  in several types of breast cancer , including triple negative breast cancer .”  \n \n“Triple negative breast cancer is known to be particularly aggressive and fast growing, and after treatment the risk of recurrence is faster and higher than in any other breast cancer subgroup,” said Cristian Massacesi, \nSenior Vice President, Head of Late Stage Development Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “The preliminary \nresults for datopotamab deruxtecan in this cohort of pretreated patients are encouraging for this high-\npotential targeted ADC.”   \n Patients were treated with a median of four prior lines of therapy (range, 1- 9, including prior lines of therapy \nin the [neo]adjuvant or metastatic setting ) with a majority (88%) receiving more than two previous lines of \ntreatment , including a taxane (83%), platinum -based chemotherapy (50%), immunotherapy (33%) , \nsacitu zumab govitecan (8%)  and a PARP inhibitor (4%) . As of data cut -off on January 8, 2021, 75 % of \npatients remained on treatment with datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nSummary of TROPION -PanTumor01 Results  \nEfficacy Measure  Total Evaluable in TNBC Cohort ( N=21)i, ii \nORR , %iii, iv  43% (n=9)  \n     CR/PR (confirmed)       n=5 \n     CR/PR (pending confirmation)       n=4 \nDCR , %v 95% (n=20)  \nPD, % 5% (n=1)  \nCR, complete response; DCR, disease control rate; ORR, objective response rate; PD, progressive disease; PR, partial response\n3 \n i Includes response evaluable patients who had ≥1 postbaseline tumor assessment or discontinued treatment. Postbaseline tumor assessments were not \nyet available for 3 patients at the data cutoff. One patient was not confirmed to have a target lesion per BICR and therefore  had a best overall response \nof non -CR/non -PD. \nii Includes 2 patients that received 8 mg/kg datopotamab deruxtecan prior to selection of the 6 -mg/kg dose for dose expansion  \niii Includes patients with a best overall response of CR, PR, stable disease, or non -CR/non -PD. \niv ORR is CR+PR; Responses are confirmed (CRs/PRs; n=5) plus those ongoing CRs/PRs too early to be confirmed (n=4).  \nv DCR is CR+PR+SD  \n \nAbout TROPION -PanTumor01  \nTROPION -PanTumor01 is a first -in-human, open- label, two -part, multicenter phase 1 trial designed to \nevaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of datopotamab deruxtecan in patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to or relapsed from s tandard treatment or for whom no standard treatment is \navailable, including NSCLC , TNBC  and hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer . \n \nThe dose escalation  part of the study  assessed the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of datopotamab \nderuxt ecan to determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended dose for expansion in patients \nwith unresectable advanced NSCLC. The dose expansion  part of the study further assessed  the safety and \ntolerability of datopotamab deruxtecan at selected dose le vels (4 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg) in patients \nwith NSCLC. Based on the preliminary efficacy and safety, the 6 mg/kg dose has been identified as the \nrecommended dose for the NSCLC cohort . \n The TNBC cohort was added in July 2020 and is currently evaluating patients with metastatic TNBC \nreceiving datopotamab deruxtecan ( 6 mg/kg ) with di sease relapse or progression with standard treatment. \nThe HR positive/HER2 negative cohort was added in March 2021  and is currently evaluating patients with \nmetastat ic HR positive/HER2 negative breast cancer receiving datopotamab deruxtecan (6  mg/kg) with \ndisease relapse or progression with standard treatment.  \n Safety endpoints include  dose limiting toxicities and serious adverse events. Efficacy endpoints include \nORR, DCR, duration of response, time to response, progression- free survival  and overall survival . \nPharmacokinetic, biomarker and immunogenicity endpoints also are being evaluated.  \n About TROP2  in Triple Negative Breast Cancer  \nTROP2 (trophoblast cell -surface antigen 2) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed in several \ntypes of solid tumors, including breast cancer .\n4 Research indicates that high TROP2 expression is associated \nwith cancer cell growth and proliferat ion and poor patient survival.4,5 While TROP2 is expressed across all \nbreast cancer subtypes, it  is overexpressed in approximately 80% of pati ents with TNBC , making it a \npromising molecular target for therapeutic development .5\n4 \n Approximately 10 to 15%  of patients with  breast cancer are considered triple negative because the tumors \ntest negative for estrogen , progesterone hormone receptors (HRs) and human epidermal growth factor 2 \nreceptor (HER2).1,2,6 An estimated 260,000 new cases of TNBC were reported  globally  in 2018 with it being \nmore common in younger wome n and those who are Black .1,2,7 Compared to patients with other breast cancer \nsubtypes, prognosis for patients with metastatic TNBC is generally worse and the disease is more likely to \nrecur following  treatment with  initial chemotherapy.1,3 Five-year survival of metastatic TNBC is estimated at \n12.2%  and median overall survival is generally less than two years .2,3  \n \nAbout Datopotamab Deruxtecan (Dato- DXd)  \nDatopotamab  deruxtecan  (Dato -DXd)  is a TROP2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Designed using \nDaiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, datopotamab deruxtecan is one of three lead ADCs in \nthe oncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanced program s in AstraZeneca’s ADC \nscientific platform .  \n \nA comprehensive development program  called TROPION  is underway globally with trials evaluating the \nefficacy and safety of d atopotamab deruxtecan across multiple solid tumors,  including NSCLC, TNBC  and \nHR+ breast cancer . Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also \nunderway.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize \ndatopotamab deruxtecan  in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. \nDaiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of datopotamab deruxtecan.  \n \nAbout  Daiichi Sankyo  Cancer Enterprise  \nThe mission of Daiichi Sankyo Cancer Enterprise is to lever age our world- class, innovative science and push \nbeyond traditional thinking to create meaningful treatments for patients with cancer. We are dedicated to \ntransforming science into value for patients, and this sense of obligation informs everything we do.

    "content": "Press Release\nDESTINY- CRC02 Phase 2 Trial of ENHERTU® Initiated in Patients \nwith HER2 Overexpressing Advanced Colorectal Cancer \nMunich and Basking Ridge, NJ – (April 6, 2021)  – Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, \nDaiichi S ankyo) and  AstraZene ca today announced t hat the  first patient was dosed in DESTINY -CRC02 , a \nglobal ph ase 2 t rial ev aluating  the efficacy an d safety of EN HERTU® (trastuzumab de ruxtecan) i n patients \nwith HE R2 overexpressi ng locally advanced, unresectable or me tastatic colorectal canc er with progression \nfollowing tr eatment with standard of care chemotherapy .  \nColorectal canc er is the third most c ommon  cancer and  seco nd most common cau se of  cancer d eath \nglobally.1 Approximately 20% of  patients have metastati c disease at diagnosis, m eaning  the disease has \nspread to distant organs, and about 50-60% of patients initially diagnosed with early stage colorectal cancer \nwill eventually develop metastases.2 There are currently no medicines approved to specifically treat HER2  \noverexpressing colorectal cancer, which affects approximately 2 to 5% of patients.3 \n“P\natients with metasta tic colorectal cancer often have limited treatment options following progression on \nstandard of care therapy , making it important to understand new ways to treat these patients. Identifying \npatients with HER2 overexpression is an important area of research  to further explore,” said Gilles Gallant, \nBPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi \nSankyo. “Based on the encouraging data from the DESTINY -CRC01 phase 2 trial, we have initiated this \nsecond phase 2  study to further evaluate the potential of targeting HER2 with ENHERTU at the 5.4 mg/kg \nand 6.4 mg/kg doses in patients with HER2 overexpressing  advanced col orectal cancer.”  \nAb\nout DESTINY- CRC02  \nDESTINY -CRC02 is a global, phase 2  trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of two doses (5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 \nmg/kg) of ENHERTU in patients with HER2  overexpressing BRAF wild -type, RAS wild -type or mutant \nlocally advanced, unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer with progression following treatment with \nstandard of care chemotherapy . Previous treatments, if clinically indicated  and not contraindicated, should \ninclude chemotherapy ( fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan); targeted therap y (anti-epidermal \ngrowth factor receptor (EGFR) treatment,  (i.e. RAS wild -type); or, a nti-vascular endothelial growth factor \n(VEGF) treatment ); and/or immunotherapy (a nti-programmed death- ligand 1 (PD -[L]-1) therapy, if tumor is \nmicrosatellite instab ility (MSI) -high/deficient mismatch re pair (dMMR), or tumor mutational burden (TMB)-\nhigh.\n2 \n  \nThe study will be conducted in two stages. In stage 1, 80 patients will be randomized  1:1 to receive either 5.4 \nmg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg of ENHERTU administered every three weeks . After enrollment is completed in s tage 1, \n40 patients  will be enrolled to the 5.4 mg/kg arm at s tage 2. The primary endpoint  is confirmed objective \nresponse rate (ORR) as assessed by blinded independent central review . Secondary endpoints include \nduration of response, disease control rate, clinical benefit ratio , investigator -assessed ORR, progression- free \nsurvival, overall survival, pharmacokinetics , patient reported outcomes  and safety.  \n DESTINY -CRC02 will enrol l approximately 120 patients  at multiple sites  in the Americas, Asia -Pacific, and \nEurope. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov . \n About HER2 Overexpressing Colorect al Cancer  \nColorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and second most common cause of cancer death \nglobally.1 Approximately 2 0% of patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis, meaning the disease has \nspread to distant organs, and about 50- 60% of patients initially diagnosed with early stage colorectal cancer \nwill eventually develop metastases .2 Many patients with metastatic dis ease eventually progress on the current \nstandard of care treatments.4 \n HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth -promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of \ntumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. Overexpression  and amplification  of HER2 \noccurs in a pproximately 2 to 5%  of patients with c olorectal cancer.\n3 Research indicates that HER2 \namplification  may be associated with resistance to anti -epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -targeted \ntherapy and shorter survival.5,6 \n \nAbout ENHERTU \nENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only)  is a HER2  \ndirected antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU  is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced \nprogram in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.  ENHERTU consists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody \nattached to  a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide- based \ncleavable linker.  \n \nENHERTU  (5.4 mg/kg) is approved under accelerated approval  in the U.S , under conditional marketing \nauthorization in the EU and the UK and under the conditional early approval system  in Japan  for the\n3 \n treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast  cancer who have received \ntwo or more prior anti -HER2 based regimens in the metastatic setting based on the results from \nthe DESTINY -Breast01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is also approved in the U.S. and Japan  for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma  who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen based on the results from the  DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.  \n \nENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo -Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication Guide .  \n ENHERTU is not currently approved in the U.S. or any region worldwide for the treatment of colorectal \ncancer.  \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n \nENHERTU was recently highlighted in the Clinical Canc er Advances 2021 report  as one of  two significant \nadvancements in the “ASCO Clinical Advance of the Year : Molecular Profiling Driving Progress in GI \nCancers,” based on data from both the DESTINY -CRC01  and DESTINY -Gastric01  trials.  \n \nIn May 2020, ENHERTU  received Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) in the U.S. for the treatment of \npatients with metastatic non -small cell lung cancer whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and with disease \nprogression on or after platinum -based therapy.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019, and datopotamab deruxtecan in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for manufacturing and supply of \nENHERTU and datopotamab de ruxtecan.\n4 \n U.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer w ho have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens in the metastatic setting.  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  \n \n• Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen.  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other  new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in \nall patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal har m. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumoniti s, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 \nto 8.3).\n5 \n Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 pati ents with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to \nfirst onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2  to 21.0).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU.  \nMonitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically \nindicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x \n109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile \nneutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than \n1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who \nreceived ENHERTU 5.4mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 62% of patients. Sixteen \npercent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil \ncount was 23 days (range: 6 to 547). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a de crease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% \nof patients. Fifty- one percent had Grade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of \npatients.  \n Left Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. In t he 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2- positive breast cancer who received \nENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY -Gastric01, of \nthe 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gast ric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with \nENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significan t cardiac disease or LVEF \n<50% prior to initiation of treatment.   \nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically \nindicated. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10- 20%, continue treat ment with \nENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease \nfrom baseline is 10 -20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat L VEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not \nrecovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within \n10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute \ndecrease from  baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF \nof <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.  \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential\n6 \n risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \nat least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 \nmonths after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then mai ntain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Breast01  \nand Study DS8201- A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. \nThe median durati on of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, \ncellu litis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of \npatients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each \n(0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and \nhemorrhagic shock.  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHE RTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions \noccurred in 18% of patients treated with E NHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (79%), white blood cell count decreased (70%), hemoglobin decreased (70%), neutrophil count decreased (62%), fatigue \n(59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (41%), alanine aminotransferase \nincreased (38%), platelet count decreased (37%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), \ndiarrhea (29%), hypokalemia (26%), and cough (20%).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2- positive \ngastric  or GEJ adenocarcinoma  in DESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly \nor paclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The me dian duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5  to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in \n2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascula r coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred \nin one patient each (0.8%).\n7 \n  \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, and febrile neutropenia.  \n The most common (≥ 20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decreased \n(75%), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (72%), lymphocyte count decreased \n(70%), platelet count decreased (68%), nausea (63%), decreased  appetite (60%), anemia (58%), aspartate \naminotransferase increased (58%), fatigue (55%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (54%),  alanine \naminotransferase increased (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), \nblood bi lirubin increased (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \n \nUse in Specific Populations  \n• Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a \nbreastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Ver ify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception du ring treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. \nMales : Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception \nduring treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the l ast dose. Infertility : ENHERTU \nmay impair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2- positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \n26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in ef ficacy were observed between \npatients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3- 4 adverse \nreactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Of the 125 patients with local ly advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥ 75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of a ge compared to \nyounger patients.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIO NS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1- 877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Inform ation , including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide .\n8 \n About  Daiichi Sankyo  Cancer Enterprise  \nThe mission of Daiichi Sankyo Cancer Enterprise is to leverage our world- class, innovative science and push \nbeyond traditional thinking to create meaningful treatments for patients with cancer.

Our initial research of ENHERTU  in the DESTINY -Lung01 trial  has \nshown impressive early results in patients with HER2 mutated metastatic non -small cell lung cancer ,” said \nGilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, Oncology Development, \nOncology R&D, Daiichi Sa nkyo. “ Building on these results, we are initiating the DESTINY -Lung02 trial to \nfurther explore the safety and efficacy of two different doses of ENHERTU  in this specific type of non- small \ncell lung cancer .” \n \nAbout DESTINY- Lung0 2 \nDESTINY -Lung02 is a global  phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of two doses (5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 \nmg/kg) of ENHERTU in patients with HER2 mutated metastatic NSCLC with  disease recurrence or \nprogression during or after at least one regimen of prior anticancer therapy that must have contained a \nplatinum- based chemotherapy drug (second line or later) .  \n \nPatients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either the 5.4  mg/kg or 6.4  mg/kg dose of ENHERTU . \nThe primary endpoint of the study is objective response rate (ORR) , as assessed by blinded independent \ncentral review . Secondary endpoints include disease control rate, duration of response, progression- free\n2 \n survival, investigator -assessed ORR , overall survival , pharmacokinetics , time to response, quality of life  and \nsafety.  \n \nDESTINY -Lung02 will enroll approximately 150 pa tients at multiple sites  including but not limited to North \nAmerica, Europe and Asia- Pacific .

HER2 gene alterations (called HER2 \nmutations) have been identified in NSCLC, specifically adenocarcinomas, as distinct molecular targets and \nhave been reported in approximately 2% to 4%  of patients with NSCLC.5,6 These HER2 gene mutations have \nbeen independently associated with cancer cell growth and poor prognosis.5  \n  \nAbout ENHERTU \nENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam -trastuzumab deruxtecan -nxki in the U.S. only)  is a HER2  \ndirected antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU  is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced \nprogram in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.  ENHERTU cons ists of a HER2 monoclonal antibody \nattached to  a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a stable tetrapeptide- based \ncleavable linker.  \n ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg)  is approved under accelerated approval  in the U.S ., under conditional marketing \nauthorization in the EU and UK , and under the conditional early approval system  in Japan for the treatment \nof adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 based regimens in the metastatic setting based on the results from the DESTINY -Breast01  \ntrial.  \n \nENHERTU  (6.4 mg/kg) is also approved in the U.S. and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with locally \nadvanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma  who have \nreceived a prior trastuzumab -based regimen  based on the results from the DESTINY -Gastric01  trial.\n3 \n ENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo- Fetal \nToxicity. For more information, please see accompanying full Prescribing Information, including Boxed \nWARNINGS, and Medication Guide .  \n \nENHERTU is not currently approved in the U.S. or any region worldwide for the treatment of NSCLC. \n \nAbout the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program  \nA comprehensive global  development program is underway evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU \nmonotherapy across m ultiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric and lung cancers. Trials in \ncombination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.  \n \nENHERTU was recently highlighted in the ASCO Clinical Cancer Advances 2021  report  as one of the \ntargeted therapy advances of the year  in NSCLC , based on the interim results of  the HER2 mutated cohort of \nthe DESTINY -Lung01 trial .  \n \nIn May 2020, ENHERTU  received Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) in the U.S. for the treatment of \npatients with metastatic non -small cell lung cancer whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and with disease \nprogression on or after platinum -based therapy.  \n \nAbout  the Daiichi  Sankyo  and AstraZeneca  Collaboration   \nDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019, and datopotamab deruxtecan in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo \nmaintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for manufacturing and supply of \nENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan . \n \nU.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU  \n \nIndications  \nENHERTU is a HER2 -directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of \nadult patients with:  \n \n• Unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti -HER2 -\nbased regimens in the metastatic setting.  \n \nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of \nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of \nclinical benefit in a confirmatory t rial.\n4 \n • Locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who \nhave received a prior trastuzumab -based regimen.  \n \n \nWARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO -FETAL TOXICITY   \n• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) a nd pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with \nENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, \nfever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patient s with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to \nimmediately report symptoms.  \n• Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo- fetal harm. Advise patients of these \nrisks and the need for effective contraception.  \n \n \nContraindications  \nNone.  \n \nWarnings and Precautions  \nInterstitial Lung Disease / Pneumonitis  \nSevere, life- threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients \ntreated with ENHERTU. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or \nworsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor pa tients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate \nevidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with \na pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade \n0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, \nreduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 \nmg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently \ndiscontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is \nsuspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue f or at least 14 days followed by \ngradual taper for at least 4 weeks.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer treated \nwith ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patient s. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis \noccurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 \nto 8.3).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to \nfirst onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2  to 21.0).  \n \nNeutropenia  \nSevere neutropenia, including febrile n eutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU.  \nMonitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 10\n9/L) interru pt \nENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x \n109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile \nneutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than \n1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nMetastatic Breast Cancer\n5 \n In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who \nreceived ENHERTU 5.4mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 62% of patients. Sixteen \npercent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil \ncount was 23 days (range: 6 to 547). Febrile neut ropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nIn DESTINY -Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or \nGEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg, a decrease in  neutrophil count was reported in 72% \nof patients. Fifty- one percent had Grade  3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of \ndecreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of \npatients.  \n \nLeft Ventricular Dysfunction  \nPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti -HER2 therapies, including \nENHERTU. In the 234 pa tients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer who received \nENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY -Gastric01, of \nthe 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GE J adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on \nechocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with \nENHERTU has not been studied in patients w ith a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF \n<50% prior to initiation of treatment.  \n \nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically \nindicated. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease f rom baseline is 10 -20%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with \nENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40 -45% and absolute decrease \nfrom baseline is 10- 20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not \nrecovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute \ndecrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF \nof <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure . \n \nEmbryo -Fetal Toxicity   \nENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential \nrisks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of \nENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for \nat least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of \nreproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 \nmonths after the last dose of ENHERTU.  \n \nAdditional Dose Modifications  \nThrombocytopenia  \nFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or \nless, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until \nresolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  \n \nAdverse Reactions  \nMetastatic Breast Cancer  \nThe saf ety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic \nHER2 -positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY -Breast01\n6 \n and Study DS8201- A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intra venous infusion once every three weeks. \nThe median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in \n>1% of patients who received ENHERTU were inte rstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, \ncellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of \npatients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each \n(0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and \nhemorrhagic shock.  \n \nENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to advers e reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. D ose reductions \noccurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated \nwith dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (79%), white \nblood cell count decreased (70%), hemoglobin decreased (70%), neutrophil count decreased (62%), fatigue \n(59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (41%), alanine aminotransferase \nincreased (38%), pl atelet count decreased (37%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), \ndiarrhea (29%), hypokalemia (26%), and cough (20%).  \n \nLocally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer  \nThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive \ngastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma  in DESTINY -Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of \neither ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2 biweekly \nor paclitaxel  (N=7) 80 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: \n0.7 to  22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5  to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.  \n \nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse \nreactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, \npneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in \n2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred \nin one patient each (0.8%).  \n ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose \ninterruptions due to adve rse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent \nadverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, \nleukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, \ndiarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most \nfrequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, \nnausea, an d febrile neutropenia.  \n \nThe most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decreased \n(75%), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (72%), lymphocyte count decreased \n(70%), platelet coun t decreased (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), anemia (58%), aspartate \naminotransferase increased (58%), fatigue (55%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (54%),  alanine aminotransferase increased (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vo miting (26%), constipation (24%), \nblood bilirubin increased (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).  \n Use in Specific Populations\n7 \n • Pregnancy:  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of \nthe potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or \nif a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the l ast dose of ENHERTU.  \n• Lactation:  There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the \nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise wo men not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after \nthe last dose.  \n• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:  Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of \nreproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contracep tion: Females : ENHERTU can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use \neffective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. \nMales : Advise male p atients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception \nduring treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility : ENHERTU \nmay impair male reproductive function and fertility.  \n• Pediatric Use:  Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.  \n• Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2- positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4  mg/kg, \n26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in eff icacy were observed between \npatients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3- 4 adverse \nreactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Of the \n125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 -positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated \nwith ENHERTU 6.4  mg/kg in DESTINY -Gastric01, 56% were ≥65 years and 14% were ≥ 75 years. No \noverall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients ≥65 years of ag e compared to \nyounger patients.  \n• Hepatic Impairment:  In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, \nclosely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.  \n \nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1- 877-437-7763 or \nFDA at 1 -800-FDA- 1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.   \n \nPlease see accompanying full Prescribing Informa tion, including Boxed WARNINGS, and Medication \nGuide.  \n \nAbout Daiichi Sankyo Cancer Enterprise  \nThe mission of Daiichi Sankyo Cancer Enterprise is to leverage our world- class, innova tive science and push \nbeyond traditional thinking to create meaningful treatments for patients with cancer.

This press release features multimedia. View the full releasehereOpen new window.. In the U.S., gastric cancer is more frequently diagnosed in the advanced stage, with only approximately 5% of patients surviving five years.1,2Approximately one in five gastric cancers are HER2 positive.3 “Patients with metastatic HER2 positive gastric cancer with progression following first-line treatment have historically faced poor outcomes, including low response to treatment and rapid disease progression,” said Ronan Kelly, MD, MBA, Director of the Charles A. Sammons Cancer Center and the W.W. Caruth, Jr. Chair of Immunology at Baylor University Medical Center, Dallas, Texas. “This approval represents the first time a HER2 directed medicine has demonstrated a significant improvement in survival compared to chemotherapy for patients following initial treatment in the metastatic setting and it has the potential to become the new standard of care for this patient population.” Regular approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was based on the positive results from the randomized pivotalDESTINY-Gastric01Open new window.phase 2 trial, in which ENHERTU demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR) versus chemotherapy (irinotecan or paclitaxel) in patients with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who had progressed on at least two prior regimens including trastuzumab, a fluoropyrimidine and a platinum-containing chemotherapy. ENHERTU is approved with Boxed WARNINGS for interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis and embryo-fetal toxicity. In the DESTINY-Gastric01 trial, patients (n=126) in the ENHERTU treatment arm had a 41% reduction in the risk of death versus patients (n=62) treated with chemotherapy (based on a hazard ratio [HR] of 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39-0.88; p=0.0097) at a pre-specified interim analysis with a median OS of 12.5 months [95% CI 9.6-14.3] versus 8.4 months [95% CI 6.9-10.7] with chemotherapy. Confirmed ORR, assessed by independent central review, was a major efficacy outcome. Results showed a confirmed ORR of 40.5% [95% CI 31.8-49.6] with ENHERTU compared to 11.3% [95% CI 4.7-21.9] with chemotherapy. Patients treated with ENHERTU had a 7.9% complete response rate (n=10) and a 32.5% partial response rate (n=41) compared to a complete response rate of 0% (n=0) and a partial response rate of 11.3% (n=7) for patients treated with chemotherapy. Additionally, ENHERTU showed a median duration of response (DoR) of 11.3 months [95% CI 5.6-NR] versus 3.9 months [95% CI 3.0-4.9] with chemotherapy. ENHERTU also demonstrated a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.6 months [95% CI 4.3-6.9] compared to 3.5 months [95% CI 2.0-4.3] (HR=0.47; 95% CI 0.31-0.71) with chemotherapy. Results from the DESTINY-Gastric01 trial were presented at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting and published inThe New England Journal of MedicineOpen new window..4 ENHERTU is approved with Boxed WARNINGS for interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis and embryo-fetal toxicity. The safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in DESTINY-Gastric01. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%), including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decreased, white blood cell count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, lymphocyte count decreased, platelet count decreased, nausea, decreased appetite, anemia, aspartate aminotransferase increased, fatigue, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, alanine aminotransferase increased, diarrhea, hypokalemia, vomiting, constipation, blood bilirubin increased, pyrexia, and alopecia. In DESTINY-Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, interstitial lung disease occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset of ILD was 2.8 months (range: 1.2 to 21.0). “ENHERTU is the first antibody drug conjugate to receive approval in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with metastatic gastric cancer, and represents a major advance in managing this difficult-to-treat disease,” said Antoine Yver, MD, MSc, Executive Vice President and Global Head, Oncology Research and Development, Daiichi Sankyo. “This second indication in the U.S. represents an important step forward in our ambitious plan to accelerate the development of ENHERTU across a broad range of HER2 targetable cancers.” “Today’s approval of ENHERTU represents the first HER2 directed medicine approved in a decade for patients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer,” said Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, AstraZeneca. “The results from the DESTINY-Gastric01 trial highlight the potential to change clinical practice, showing a forty-one percent improvement in survival and a response rate more than three times higher with ENHERTU compared to chemotherapy. We are thrilled to bring this important medicine to more patients and physicians in the U.S.” This is the second regulatory approval for ENHERTU in the U.S. ENHERTU is also approved in the U.S. under accelerated approval, and in Japan, under the conditional early approval system, for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting based on the DESTINY-Breast01 trial. ENHERTU is also approved in Japan for HER2 positive unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer that has progressed after chemotherapy based on the DESTINY-Gastric01 trial. ENHERTU previously received Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with previously treated HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer, as well as Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for patients with gastric cancer, including gastroesophageal junction cancer.

About Gastric CancerGastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer mortality with a five-year survival rate of 5% for metastatic disease; there were approximately one million new cases reported in 2020 and more than 768,000 deaths.2,5In the U.S., it is estimated that 27,600 new cases of gastric cancer were diagnosed in 2020 and more than 11,000 people died from the disease.6 Approximately one in five gastric cancers are HER2 positive.3HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancer. Gastric cancer is usually diagnosed in the advanced stage, but even when diagnosed in earlier stages of the disease, the survival rate remains modest.1Recommended first-line treatment for HER2 positive advanced or metastatic gastric cancer is combination chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 medicine, which has been shown to improve survival outcomes when added to chemotherapy. For patients with metastatic gastric cancer that progresses following initial treatment with a trastuzumab-based regimen, there were previously no other approved HER2 targeted medicines prior to the approval of ENHERTU.3 About DESTINY-Gastric01DESTINY-Gastric01 is an open-label, multi-center, randomized, pivotal phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) versus investigator’s choice of chemotherapy in a primary cohort of 188 patients from Japan and South Korea with HER2 positive (defined as IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+), advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who had progressed on two or more prior treatment regimens including trastuzumab, a fluoropyrimidine and platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive ENHERTU or investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel or irinotecan monotherapy). Patients were treated with ENHERTU 6.4mg/kg once every three weeks or chemotherapy. The main efficacy outcome measures were ORR assessed by independent central review according to RECIST v1.1 and OS in the intent-to-treat population. Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS and DoR. About ENHERTUENHERTU®(trastuzumab deruxtecan; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the U.S.) is a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC). Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. ENHERTU is comprised of a humanized anti-HER2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody with the same amino acid sequence as trastuzumab attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, an exatecan derivative, via a tetrapeptide-based cleavable linker. ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. under accelerated approval, and in Japan, under the conditional early approval system, for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting based on the DESTINY-Breast01 trial, and received a CHMP positive opinion in December 2020 as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens. ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is also approved in the U.S. and Japan for the treatment of previously treated patients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer based on the DESTINY-Gastric01 trial. About the ENHERTU Clinical Development ProgramA comprehensive development program is underway globally with nine pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway. In May 2020, ENHERTU received BTD in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy. In March 2020, the European Medicines Agency’s CHMP granted ENHERTU accelerated assessment for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens. About the Collaboration between Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZenecaDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU (a HER2 directed ADC) inMarch 2019, and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd; DS-1062; a TROP2 directed ADC) inJuly 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan. U.S. Important Safety Information for ENHERTU IndicationsENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with: ContraindicationsNone.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate systemic corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg/day prednisolone or equivalent) and continue for at least 14 days followed by gradual taper for at least 4 weeks. Metastatic Breast CancerIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric CancerIn DESTINY-Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, ILD occurred in 10% of patients. Median time to first onset was 2.8 months (range: 1.2 to 21.0). Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU.Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.Metastatic Breast CancerIn clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU 5.4mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 62% of patients. Sixteen percent had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 23 days (range: 6 to 547). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric CancerIn DESTINY-Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 72% of patients. Fifty-one percent had Grade 3 or 4 decreased neutrophil count. Median time to first onset of decreased neutrophil count was 16 days (range: 4 to 187). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4.8% of patients. Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. In DESTINY-Gastric01, of the 125 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg, no clinical adverse events of heart failure were reported; however, on echocardiography, 8% were found to have asymptomatic Grade 2 decrease in LVEF. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.Additional Dose ModificationsThrombocytopeniaFor Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 to 25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 1 or less. Reduce dose by one level.  Metastatic Breast CancerThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were nausea (79%), white blood cell count decreased (70%), hemoglobin decreased (70%), neutrophil count decreased (62%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (41%), alanine aminotransferase increased (38%), platelet count decreased (37%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), diarrhea (29%), hypokalemia (26%), and cough (20%).Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric CancerThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in 187 patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in DESTINY-Gastric01. Patients intravenously received at least one dose of either ENHERTU (N=125) 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or either irinotecan (N=55) 150 mg/m2biweekly or paclitaxel (N=7) 80 mg/m2weekly for 3 weeks. The median duration of treatment was 4.6 months (range: 0.7 to 22.3) in the ENHERTU group and 2.8 months (range: 0.5 to 13.1) in the irinotecan/paclitaxel group.Serious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg. Serious adverse reactions in >2% of patients who received ENHERTU were decreased appetite, ILD, anemia, dehydration, pneumonia, cholestatic jaundice, pyrexia, and tumor hemorrhage. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 2.4% of patients: disseminated intravascular coagulation, large intestine perforation, and pneumonia occurred in one patient each (0.8%).ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 15% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 62% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, decreased appetite, leukopenia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ILD, pneumonia, lymphopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, and hypokalemia. Dose reductions occurred in 32% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were neutropenia, decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, and febrile neutropenia.The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were hemoglobin decreased (75%), white blood cell count decreased (74%), neutrophil count decreased (72%), lymphocyte count decreased (70%), platelet count decreased (68%), nausea (63%), decreased appetite (60%), anemia (58%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (58%), fatigue (55%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (54%), alanine aminotransferase increased (47%), diarrhea (32%), hypokalemia (30%), vomiting (26%), constipation (24%), blood bilirubin increased (24%), pyrexia (24%), and alopecia (22%).

U.S. FDA-Approved Indication for ENHERTUENHERTU is a HER2 directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. ContraindicationsNone.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).  Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who receivedENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level. Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  The safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock. ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).

    "content": "PDFPDF For Immediate Release Company name: DAIICHI SANKYO COMPANY, LIMITEDRepresentative: Sunao Manabe, Representative Director, President and CEO(Code no.: 4568, First Section, Tokyo Stock Exchange)Please address inquiries to Junichi Onuma,Vice President, Corporate Communications DepartmentTelephone: +81-3-6225-1126https://www.daiichisankyo.com Tokyo, Munich and Basking Ridge, N.J. – (December 10, 2020)– Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (hereafter, Daiichi Sankyo) today presented the first immunotherapy combination study results for ENHERTU® (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki), reporting preliminary results from two cohorts of a four cohort phase 1b trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU in combination with nivolumab,  a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor, in patients with previously treated HER2 positive or HER2 low metastatic breast cancer. Results were presented in a Spotlight Poster Discussion at the virtual 2020 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (#SABCS20).This interim analysis found that the combination of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) and nivolumab (360 mg), administered every three weeks, was well tolerated in patients with HER2 positive or HER2 low metastatic breast cancer, providing the first data showing that ENHERTU may be safely combined with an immunotherapy agent, at therapeutic doses of both agents and for a meaningful treatment duration.The overall safety and tolerability of ENHERTU and nivolumab combination therapy was similar to that seen with ENHERTU monotherapy in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer and nivolumab monotherapy across tumors. No new safety signals were observed; however, the rate of treatment-emergent adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (18.8%) was numerically higher with the combination than previous reports from either monotherapy alone. There were no dose limiting toxicities observed in part 1 of the trial. Overall, 43.8% of patients experienced a grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse event, with 18.8% identified as events related to ENHERTU and 18.8% related to nivolumab. The most common any-grade treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (54.2%), fatigue (45.8%), and alopecia (41.7%). There were five cases (10.4%, all HER2 positive) of treatment-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis, determined by an independent adjudication committee, including one death (grade 5). The remaining four cases were grade 2.Preliminary efficacy results for 48 evaluable patients found that patients in the HER2 positive cohort (n=32) and the HER2 low cohort (n=16) showed a confirmed objective response rate of 59% and 38%, respectively. Disease control rates of 91% and 75% were observed in the HER2 positive and HER2 low cohorts, respectively. Median duration of response has not yet been reached in either cohort.“As HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer continues to progress, and multiple lines of HER2 directed therapy have been exhausted, consideration needs to be given to evaluating a combination of medicines with different mechanisms of action,” said Erika Hamilton, MD, Director, Breast Cancer and Gynecologic Cancer Research Program, Sarah Cannon Research Institute at Tennessee Oncology. “These preliminary data provide a promising signal that ENHERTU, a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate, may be combined with nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Longer follow-up and more research is needed to determine whether adding immunotherapy to ENHERTU to treat HER2 positive or HER2 low metastatic breast cancer may provide further clinical benefit than receiving ENHERTU alone.”“Additional treatment strategies are needed for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer as the disease still remains incurable,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “These initial findings indicate treatment with ENHERTU and nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, may be combined and administered for longer periods of time. These findings also support our broader research effort to better understand whether the directed delivery of potent chemotherapy with ENHERTU along with immunotherapy may benefit patients with HER2 expressing metastatic breast cancer regardless of the levels of HER2 expression.”In the phase 1b study, the majority of patients in the HER2 positive (88%) and HER2 low (75%) cohorts had received four or more prior therapies. Median duration of treatment with ENHERTU was 6.5 months (range, 1.4-14.0 months) in the HER2 positive cohort and 6.3 months (range, 0.7-10.4 months) in the HER2 low cohort. The median duration of treatment with nivolumab was 5.2 months (range, 1.3-11.3 months) and 4.9 months (range, 0.7-10.4 months) in the HER2 positive and HER2 low cohorts, respectively. Median duration of follow-up was 7.0 months for HER2 positive patients and 6.9 months for HER2 low patients. As of data cut-off on June 8, 2020, 56.3% of HER2 positive and 50.0% of HER2 low patients remained on treatment with ENHERTU. Fifty percent of HER2 positive and 43.8% of HER2 low patients remained on treatment with nivolumab.About About the TrialThe trial is a two-part, phase 1b, multicenter, open-label trial evaluating ENHERTU in combination with nivolumab in patients with HER2 expressing breast and urothelial cancer that experience disease progression during or after prior therapies, did not respond to standard therapies, or for whom no standard therapy is currently available.The trial was performed in two parts: Part 1 evaluated different doses of ENHERTU when given along with a fixed dose of nivolumab (360 mg), administered every three weeks, to determine the recommended dose for expansion (RDE); Part 2 assessed the efficacy and safety of this dose combination at the RDE. Part 2 of the trial enrolled patients into four cohorts: cohort 1 was comprised of patients with HER2 positive breast cancer who had received prior treatment with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1); cohort 2 was comprised of patients with HER2 low triple negative breast cancer who had previously received standard treatment; cohorts 3 and 4 are comprised of patients with HER2 high or HER2 low expressing urothelial cancer, respectively, who had received prior platinum-based therapy with documented progression and had not received prior immunotherapy.The primary efficacy endpoint in Part 2 of the trial is objective response rate confirmed by independent central review. Additional efficacy endpoints include duration of response, disease control rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, safety, and pharmacokinetics.About HER2 Expressing Breast CancerBreast cancer occurs mainly in women but in rare cases, it can also occur in men.1In women, breast cancer is the most common cancer and one of the most common causes of cancer mortality worldwide; there were an estimated 2.1 million new cases of female breast cancer diagnosed in 2018.1Breast cancer occurs mainly in women but in rare cases, it can also occur in men.2HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including gastric, breast and lung cancers. HER2 overexpression is associated with a specific HER2 gene alteration known as HER2 amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis.3Approximately one in five breast cancers are HER2 positive, and an additional 40% of all breast cancers may have low levels of HER2 expression.456Despite recent improvements and approvals of new medicines, metastatic breast cancer remains incurable and additional treatment strategies are needed for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.78Currently, no anti-HER2 agents are indicated for HER2 low expressing tumors.About ENHERTUENHERTU is a HER2 directed ADC and is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is comprised of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker.ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. under Accelerated Approval and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens based on theDESTINY-Breast01Open new window.trial. ENHERTU is approved in the U.S. with Boxed WARNINGS for Interstitial Lung Disease and Embryo-Fetal Toxicity.ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is also approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer that has progressed after chemotherapy based on theDESTINY-Gastric01Open new window.trial. A comprehensive development program is underway globally with eight registrational trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.In October 2020, ENHERTU was granted Priority Review from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. In May 2020, ENHERTU received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) and Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for gastric cancer, including GEJ adenocarcinoma.In May 2020, ENHERTU also received a BTD for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy. ENHERTU is not approved in the U.S. in either NSCLC or gastric cancer.In July 2020, the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use granted accelerated assessment for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens. Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU (a HER2 directed ADC) inMarch 2019Open new window., and DS-1062 (a TROP2 directed ADC) inJuly 2020Open new window., except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and DS-1062. U.S. FDA-Approved Indication for ENHERTUENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. ContraindicationsNone.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).  Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).  Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  The safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock. ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia. The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).

Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is comprised of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker.ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. under Accelerated Approval and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens based on theDESTINY-Breast01Open new window.trial. ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) is also approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer that has progressed after chemotherapy based on theDESTINY-Gastric01Open new window.trial. A comprehensive development program is underway globally with eight registrational trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.In October 2020, ENHERTU was granted Priority Review from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. In May 2020, ENHERTU received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) and Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for gastric cancer, including GEJ adenocarcinoma.In May 2020, ENHERTU also received a BTD for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy. ENHERTU is not approved in the U.S. in either NSCLC or gastric cancer.In July 2020, the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use granted accelerated assessment for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens.  Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU (a HER2 directed ADC) inMarch 2019Open new window., and DS-1062 (a TROP2 directed ADC) inJuly 2020Open new window., except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and DS-1062. U.S. FDA-Approved Indication for ENHERTUENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  ContraindicationsNone.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).  Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).  Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  The safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock. ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia. The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).

The PDUFA date has been set for the first quarter of the 2021 calendar year. There are more than 27,000 new cases of gastric cancer in the U.S. each year, of which approximately one in five are HER2 positive.1,2For patients with metastatic gastric cancer who progress on initial treatment with an anti-HER2 regimen, there are no other approved HER2 directed medicines.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grants Priority Review to applications for medicines that offer significant advances over available options by demonstrating safety or efficacy improvements, preventing serious conditions, or enhancing patient compliance.The sBLA is based on results from the randomized phase 2DESTINY-Gastric01Open new window.trial, which demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in objective response rate (ORR), the primary endpoint, and overall survival (OS), a key secondary endpoint, for patients treated with ENHERTUversus chemotherapy (paclitaxel or irinotecan monotherapy). The results from the trialwere presented during the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Virtual Scientific Program and simultaneously published online inThe New England Journal of MedicineOpen new window..ENHERTU received Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) from the FDA in May 2020 for patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who have received two or more prior regimens including trastuzumab – one of three BTDs that have been granted to ENHERTU in the U.S.– and Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for patients with gastric cancer, including GEJ adenocarcinoma.The safety and tolerability profiles of ENHERTU in DESTINY-Gastric01 were consistent with that observed in the gastric cancer cohort of the phase 1 trial and previously reported ENHERTUtrials in other tumors.The most common grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events were decreased neutrophil count, anemia, decreased white blood cell count and decreased appetite. There were 12 cases (9.6%) of confirmed treatmentrelated interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis in 125 patients treated with ENHERTU as determined by an independent adjudication committee. The majority of cases were grade 1 or 2 with two grade 3, one grade 4 and no grade 5 (no ILD-related deaths).“The results of the DESTINY-Gastric01 trial are unprecedented as they represent the first time a HER2 directed medicine has demonstrated an improvement in survival following chemotherapy and HER2 treatment in the metastatic setting,” said Antoine Yver, MD, MSc, Executive Vice President and Global Head, Oncology Research and Development, Daiichi Sankyo. “Building on the recent Breakthrough Therapy Designation, the filing of the application and Priority Review by the FDA for this potential new indication for ENHERTU reflects the importance of the data and the significant unmet need for patients with previously treated HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer.”“Once patients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer progress following initial treatment with an anti-HER2 regimen, there are no approved HER2 directed medicines,” said José Baselga, MD, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “The prognosis for these patients is poor as available treatment options offer only limited clinical benefit. This milestone brings us one step closer to delivering this potentially practice-changing medicine to patients with gastric cancer in the U.S.”   About Gastric CancerGastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer mortality with a five-year survival rate of 5% for metastatic disease; there were approximately one million new cases reported in 2018 and 783,000 deaths.3,4In the U.S., it is estimated that 27,600 new cases of gastric cancer will be diagnosed in 2020 and more than 11,000 people will die from the disease.1Approximately one in five gastric cancers are HER2 positive.2HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growthpromoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. Gastric cancer is usually diagnosed in the advanced stage, but even when diagnosed in earlier stages of the disease the survival rate remains modest.5Recommended first-line treatment for HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer is combination chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 medicine, which has been shown to improve survival outcomes when added to chemotherapy.6For metastatic gastric cancer that progresses on first-line treatment, there are no other approved HER2 targeting medicines.7 About DESTINY-Gastric01DESTINY-Gastric01 is an open-label, multi-center, randomized, pivotal phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU versus investigator’s choice of chemotherapyin a primary cohort of 188 patients from Japan and South Korea with HER2 positive (defined as IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+), advanced gastric cancer or GEJ adenocarcinoma who had progressed on two or more prior treatment regimens including fluoropyrimidine (5-FU), platinum chemotherapy and trastuzumab. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receiveENHERTUor investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel or irinotecan monotherapy). Patients were treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or chemotherapy.The primary endpoint of the trial is ORR, as assessed by independent central review. OS, a key secondary endpoint, was to be evaluated hierarchically at a prespecified interim analysis if the primary endpoint was statistically significant. Additional efficacy endpoints include progression-free survival, duration of response, disease control rate and confirmed ORR assessed in those responses confirmed by a follow-up scan of at least four weeks after initial independent central review.   ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the U.S. only; trastuzumab deruxtecan outside the U.S.) is a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) and is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of DaiichiSankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is comprised of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker.ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg)is approved in the U.S. and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens in the metastatic setting based on the DESTINY-Breast01 trial, and is under accelerated assessment in the European Union for HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer. Recently, in September 2020, ENHERTU (6.4. mg/kg) was approved in Japan for patients with HER2 positive unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer that has progressed after chemotherapy.ENHERTU has not been approved in the EU, or countries outside of Japan and the U.S., for any indication. It is an investigational agent globally for various indications. Safety and effectiveness have not been established for the subject proposed use in the U.S. or EU.   A comprehensive development program is underway globally with eight registrational trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.In May 2020,ENHERTU received BTD from the U.S. FDA for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive unresectable or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who have received two or more prior regimens including trastuzumab and Orphan Drug Designation for gastric cancer, including GEJ adenocarcinoma. Two additional phase 2 trialsDESTINY-Gastric02Open new window.andDESTINY-Gastric03Open new window.are underway further evaluating the use of ENHERTU in patients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer.In May 2020, ENHERTU also received a BTD for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.In July 2020, the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use granted ENHERTU accelerated assessment for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens.   Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU (a HER2 directed ADC) inMarch 2019,and DS-1062 (a TROP2 directed ADC) inJuly 2020,except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and DS-1062. U.S. FDA-Approved Indication for ENHERTUENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  ContraindicationsNone.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).  Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).  Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment withENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.  ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  The safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.  ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).

ENHERTU was previously granted SAKIGAKE designation by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for this indication.Japan has the third highest incidence rate of gastric cancer worldwide, of which approximately one in five cases are considered HER2 positive.[1],[2] For patients with metastatic gastric cancer previously treated with two prior regimens including chemotherapy and an anti-HER2 therapy, ENHERTU is the first and only HER2 directed medicine to demonstrate significant improvement in overall survival compared to chemotherapy.Approval of ENHERTU in Japan is based on the results of the open-label, randomized phase 2DESTINY-Gastric01trial of ENHERTU (6.4 mg/kg) versus investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (irinotecan or paclitaxel) in 187 patients (including 149 Japanese patients) with HER2 positive advanced gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. A statistically significant increase in objective response rate (ORR) of 51.3% [95% CI: 41.9-60.5], the primary endpoint of the study, was demonstrated with ENHERTU compared to 14.3% [95% CI: 6.4 – 26.2] with investigator’s choice of chemotherapy as assessed by independent central review in 175 evaluable patients (including 140 Japanese patients). Patients treated with ENHERTU had a 41% reduction in the risk of death compared to patients treated with chemotherapy (based on a hazard ratio [HR] of 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.39-0.88; p=0.0097) at a pre-specified interim analysis. The median overall survival was 12.5 months with ENHERTU versus 8.4 months with chemotherapy.Efficacy and safety of ENHERTU in patients with HER2 positive unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer without a prior trastuzumab-containing regimen has not been established. ENHERTU is approved in Japan with a warning for interstitial lung disease (ILD). As cases of ILD, including fatal cases, have occurred in ENHERTU-treated patients, ENHERTU is to be used in close collaboration with a respiratory disease expert. Closely observe patients during therapy by monitoring for early signs or symptoms of ILD (such as dyspnea, cough or fever) and regularly perform peripheral artery oxygen saturation (SpO2) tests, chest X-ray scans and chest CT scans. If abnormalities are observed, discontinue administration of ENHERTU, and take appropriate measures such as corticosteroid administration. Prior to initiation of ENHERTU therapy, perform a chest CT scan and interview to confirm the absence of any comorbidity or history of ILD with the patient, and carefully consider the eligibility of the patient for ENHERTU therapy.“Today’s approval of ENHERTU in Japan is significant as it is the first HER2 directed therapy to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival compared to chemotherapy for previously treated patients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer,” said Wataru Takasaki, PhD, Executive Officer, Head of R&D Division in Japan, Daiichi Sankyo. “We are proud of the quality and speed in which we were able to deliver this second indication to patients and physicians in Japan as it highlights our commitment to transforming science into innovative therapies for patients with cancer.”The overall safety and tolerability profile of ENHERTU in the DESTINY-Gastric01 trial was consistent with that observed in previously reported ENHERTU trials. Drug related adverse reactions occurred in 122 patients (97.6%) of the 125 patients (including 99 Japanese patients) who received ENHERTU. The most common adverse reactions were neutrophil count decreased in 78 patients (62.4%), nausea in 72 patients (57.6%), decreased appetite in 66 patients (52.8%), anemia in 51 patients (40.8%), platelet count decreased in 48 patients (38.4%), leukocyte count decreased in 47 patients (37.6%), malaise in 43 patients (34.4%), diarrhea in 31 patients (24.8%), alopecia in 28 patients (22.4%), lymphocyte count decreased in 27 patients (21.6%), vomiting in 26 patients (20.8%), and others. In Japanese patients, ILD occurred in 11 of 99 patients (11.1%).About Gastric CancerGastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer mortality with a five-year survival rate of 5% for metastatic disease; there were approximately one million new cases reported in 2018 and 783,000 deaths.[3],[4] Incidence rates for gastric cancer are markedly higher in eastern Asia, where approximately half of all cases occur.[5],[6] Japan has the third highest incidence rate of gastric cancer worldwide; in 2018, the age-standardized rate in Japan was 27.5 per 100,000.1,[7]Approximately one in five gastric cancers are HER2 positive.2 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including breast, gastric and colorectal cancers. Gastric cancer is usually diagnosed in the advanced stage, but even when diagnosed in earlier stages of the disease the survival rate remains modest.[8] Recommended first-line treatment for HER2 positive advanced or metastatic gastric cancer is combination chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 agent, which has been shown to improve outcomes when added to chemotherapy.[9] For metastatic gastric cancer that progresses on first line treatment with chemotherapy and an anti-HER2 regimen, ENHERTU is the first and only HER2 directed medicine to demonstrate significant improvement in overall survival.About DESTINY-Gastric01DESTINY-Gastric01is an open-label, multi-center, randomized, pivotal phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU in a primary cohort of patients from Japan and South Korea with HER2 overexpressing (defined as IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+) advanced gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who had progressed on two or more prior treatment regimens including fluoropyrimidine (5-FU), platinum chemotherapy and trastuzumab. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive ENHERTU or investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel or irinotecan monotherapy). Patients were treated with ENHERTU 6.4mg/kg once every three weeks or chemotherapy.The primary endpoint of the trial is ORR, as assessed by independent central review. ORR, or tumor response rate, represents the percentage of patients whose disease decreases and/or disappears. OS is a key secondary endpoint to be statistically evaluated hierarchically if the primary endpoint was statistically significant. Other secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DoR), disease control rate (DCR) and confirmed ORR assessed in those responses confirmed by a follow-up scan of at least 4 weeks after initial independent central review.About ENHERTUENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan in Japan and other regions of the world; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the U.S.) is a HER2 directed ADC and is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is comprised of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker.In addition to approval in Japan for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer that has progressed after chemotherapy, ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is also approved in Japan and the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens in the metastatic setting based on the DESTINY-Breast01 trial.ENHERTU has not been approved in the EU, or countries outside of Japan and the U.S., for any indication. It is an investigational agent globally for various indications. Safety and effectiveness have not been established for the proposed uses being investigated in ongoing studies.About the Clinical Development ProgramA comprehensive development program is underway globally with eight registrational trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 cancers including breast, gastric and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, are also underway.In May 2020, ENHERTU received Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have received two or more prior regimens including trastuzumab and Orphan Drug Designation for gastric cancer, including gastroesophageal junction cancer.In May 2020, ENHERTU also received a BTD for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.In July 2020, the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use granted ENHERTU accelerated assessment for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens.About the Collaboration between Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZenecaDaiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU (a HER2 directed ADC) inMarch 2019, and DS-1062 (a TROP2 directed ADC) inJuly 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and DS-1062.U.S. FDA-Approved Indication for ENHERTUENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY●　Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms.●　Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.ContraindicationsNone.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSInterstitial Lung Disease / PneumonitisSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).NeutropeniaSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.Left Ventricular DysfunctionPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.Embryo-Fetal ToxicityENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.Adverse ReactionsThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).Use in Specific Populations●Pregnancy:ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU.●Lactation:There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose.●Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility: ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility.●Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.●Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%).●Hepatic Impairment: In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1-877-437-7763 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or fda.gov/medwatch.Please see accompanying fullPrescribing Information, including Boxed WARNING, andMedication Guide.About Daiichi Sankyo Cancer EnterpriseThe mission of Daiichi Sankyo Cancer Enterprise is to leverage our world-class, innovative science and push beyond traditional thinking to create meaningful treatments for patients with cancer.

Trastuzumab deruxtecan was granted accelerated assessment by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).  Validation confirms that the application is complete and commences the scientific review process by the EMA’s CHMP. Accelerated assessment is granted by the CHMP to products expected to be of major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation and can significantly reduce the review timelines.  “The accelerated assessment highlights the significant unmet need for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer that trastuzumab deruxtecan aims at addressing,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “Trastuzumab deruxtecan is already available for patients in the U.S. and Japan, and we look forward to working with the EMA to bring this important new medicine to patients in the EU as quickly as possible.”  The MAA is based on the positive results from the pivotal phase 2 DESTINY-Breast01 trial of trastuzumab deruxtecan monotherapy in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer who had received two or more prior anti-HER2 regimens. The results of the DESTINY-Breast01 trial are published inThe New England Journal of MedicineOpen new window..  About HER2 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including gastric, breast and lung cancers. HER2 overexpression is associated with a specific HER2 gene alteration known as HER2 amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poorer prognosis.[1]  About HER2 Positive Breast Cancer Approximately one in five breast cancers are HER2 positive.[2],[3]Despite recent improvements and approvals of new medicines, there remain significant clinical needs for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.[4],[5]This disease remains incurable with patients eventually progressing after available treatment.5  About Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Trastuzumab deruxtecan (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed ADC and is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform.  ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, trastuzumab deruxtecan is comprised of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker.  Trastuzumab deruxtecan (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens based on the DESTINY-Breast01 trial.

Patients with TNBC, an aggressive subtype of breast cancer, have limited treatment options beyond standard chemotherapy.[1]High TROP2 expression has been reported in up to 80 percent of patients with TNBC.[2],[3]  “Following the promising preliminary results reported with DS-1062 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, we have expanded the study to include patients with triple negative breast cancer,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “We continue to follow the science to determine whether DS-1062, designed with our proprietary DXd ADC technology, could serve as a new TROP2 directed therapy option for patients with TNBC and other cancers.”  About the Phase 1 Study The first-in-human, open-label, two-part, multi-centerphase 1 studyOpen new window.is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of DS-1062 in patients with TROP2 unselected advanced solid tumors, which are refractory to or relapsed from standard treatment or for whom no standard treatment is available.  The first part of the study (dose escalation) assessed the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of DS-1062 to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE) in patients with unresectable advanced NSCLC. The second part of the study (dose expansion) is further assessing the safety and tolerability of DS-1062 at selected dose levels for NSCLC. A cohort of patients with unresectable/advanced or metastatic TNBC has been added.  ThestudyOpen new window.is currently enrolling approximately 180 patients in the U.S. and Japan with advanced unresectable NSCLC to receive DS-1062 at doses of 4, 6, and 8 mg/kg, and approximately 40 patients with advanced/unresectable or metastatic TNBC will receive DS-1062 at the 8 mg/kg dose. Patient enrollment in the dose expansion part of the study may be further expanded to include additional tumor types.  Safety endpoints include dose limiting toxicities and serious adverse events. Efficacy endpoints include objective response rate, duration of response, disease control rate, time to response, progression-free survival and overall survival. Pharmacokinetic, biomarker and immunogenicity endpoints also will be evaluated.  Updated data from this study in patients with heavily pre-treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were recently presented at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Virtual Scientific Program (#ASCO20).  About TROP2 TROP2 (trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed in many cancers including up to 80 percent of patients with triple negative breast cancer.2,3 High TROP2 expression also has been identified in a majority of NSCLCs.[4]Research indicates that high TROP2 expression is associated with cancer cell growth and proliferation and poor patient survival.[5]TROP2 is recognized as a promising molecular target for therapeutic development in various cancers.5  About Triple Negative Breast Cancer Approximately 10 to 20 percent of breast cancers are considered triple negative because the tumors test negative for estrogen and progesterone hormone receptors (HRs) and for human epidermal growth factor 2 receptor (HER2).[6]Patients with TNBC have limited treatment options beyond standard chemotherapy.6 An aggressive breast cancer subtype, TNBC is more likely to recur following initial chemotherapy compared to other breast cancers.[7]Overall, prognosis for patients with metastatic TNBC is worse than for the other breast cancer subtypes, and more effective therapeutic options are needed.6  About DS-1062 DS-1062 is one of three lead DXd antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) in the oncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo. ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells.  Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, DS-1062 is comprised of a humanized anti-TROP2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker with a customized drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of four to optimize the benefit-risk ratio for the intended patient population.  Preclinical studies have demonstrated that DS-1062 selectively binds to the TROP2 receptor on the surface of a tumor cell. It is proposed that DS-1062 is then internalized into the cancer cell where lysosomal enzymes break down the tetrapeptide-based linker and release the DXd payload.  DS-1062 is an investigational agent that has not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

These results were presented today at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology Virtual Scientific Program (#ASCO20).  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, and accounts for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths, with 80 to 85 percent classified as NSCLC.[1],[2]There are currently no medicines approved specifically for the treatment HER2 mutant NSCLC, which affects approximately two to four percent of patients with NSCLC.[3],[4]  The primary endpoint of confirmed objective response rate (ORR), also called a tumor response rate, which was assessed by independent central review (ICR), was 61.9% for patients treated with ENHERTU monotherapy (6.4 mg/kg). Patients achieved a disease control rate (DCR) of 90.5% with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 14.0 months. Median duration of response (DoR) and overall survival (OS) had not yet been reached at the time of data cut-off.  The overall safety and tolerability profile of ENHERTU in DESTINY-Lung01 was consistent with that seen in the phase 1 trial and previously reported ENHERTU trials. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment emergent adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (26.2%) and anemia (16.7%). There were five cases (11.9%) of confirmed treatment-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis as determined by an independent adjudication committee. All ILD and pneumonitis were grade 2. One grade 1 ILD is still undergoing adjudication.  “While there have been important advances in the treatment of lung cancer over the past decade, there are still patients whose tumors continue to progress despite treatment with newer targeted agents or immunotherapies,” said Egbert F. Smit, MD, PhD, Professor, Department of Thoracic Oncology at the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands and principal investigator of the DESTINY-Lung01 trial. “Understanding additional molecular targets for treatment, such as HER2, is critical to advancing treatment options for these patients and the results seen in the DESTINY-Lung01 trial are very encouraging.”  Patients were treated with a median of two prior lines of therapy (range, 1-6) with most receiving platinum-based chemotherapy (90.5%) and anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 treatment (54.8%). Median treatment duration was 7.75 months (0.7-14.3) with a median duration of follow-up of 8.0 months (1.4-14.2). As of data cut-off on November 25, 2019, 45.2% of patients with HER2 mutated metastatic NSCLC remained on treatment with ENHERTU.  “While the role of anti-HER2 treatment is well-established in breast and gastric cancers, there are no HER2 directed therapies specifically approved for lung cancer,” said Antoine Yver, MD, MSc, Executive Vice President and Global Head, Oncology Research and Development, Daiichi Sankyo. “These results validate HER2 mutations as actionable targets in lung cancer and offer further evidence that ENHERTU has the potential to transform outcomes for these patients.”  “The results seen with ENHERTU in patients with metastatic HER2 mutant non-small cell lung cancer are very exciting and highlight the role ENHERTU may have as a new treatment option for patients facing a devastating prognosis,” said José Baselga, MD, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “Further, the results demonstrate the potential of ENHERTU to treat another tumor type among patients with extremely high unmet need.”  Summary of Results  Efficacy Measure HER2 mutated Total Evaluable (n=42)i ORR (%) (95% CI)ii,iii 61.9% (45.6 - 76.4) CR (%) 2.40% PR (%) 59.50% SD (%) 28.60% DCR (%) (95% CI)iv 90.5% (77.4 - 97.3) Median DoR (months) (95% CI) NE (5.3-NE) Median PFS (months) (95% CI) 14.0 months (6.4 – 14.0) Median OS (months) (95% CI) NE (11.8 - NE)  CI, confidence interval; CR, complete response; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease; NE, not estimable i 6.4 mg/kgCI, confidence interval; CR, complete response; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease; NE, not estimable ii As assessed by independent central review iii ORR is (CR+PR) iv DCR is (CR + PR +SD)  ENHERTU recently was granted aBreakthrough Therapy Designationin the U.S. for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.  About DESTINY-Lung01 DESTINY-Lung01Open new window.is a global, phase 2, open-label, multicenter, two-cohort trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU in 170 patients with HER2 mutant or HER2 overexpressing (defined as IHC 3+ or  IHC 2+) unresectable and metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. Patients had progressed after one or more systemic therapies including chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy or immunotherapy. The primary endpoint is ORR by independent central review. ORR, or tumor response rate, represents the percentage of patients whose disease decreased and/or disappears. Key secondary endpoints include DoR, DCR, PFS and OS.  About HER2 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. In some tumors, HER2 overexpression is associated with a specific HER2 gene alteration known as amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poorer prognosis.[5]  Other HER2 gene alterations (called HER2 mutations) have been identified in NSCLC, specifically adenocarcinomas, as distinct molecular targets and have been reported in approximately two to four percent of patients with NSCLC.3,4,[6],[7]These acquired HER2 gene mutations have been independently associated with cancer cell growth and poor prognosis.3,4  About NSCLC Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women and accounts for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.1 NSCLC accounts for approximately 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancers.2 For patients with metastatic disease, prognosis is particularly poor, as only six to 10 percent will be alive five years after diagnosis.[8]The introduction of targeted therapies and checkpoint inhibitors in recent years has improved the treatment landscape for patients with advanced NSCLC; however, new approaches are needed for those who are not eligible for available treatments, or whose cancer continues to progress.[9]Currently, no medicine is specifically approved to treat patients with HER2 mutant NSCLC.  About ENHERTU ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the U.S. only; trastuzumab deruxtecan outside the U.S.) is a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) and is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC Scientific platform.

Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is comprised of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker.  ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens based on the DESTINY-Breast01 trial.  ENHERTU has not been approved in the EU, or countries outside of Japan and the U.S., for any indication. It is an investigational agent globally for various indications. Safety and effectiveness have not been established for the subject proposed use.  About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program A comprehensive development program for ENHERTU is underway globally with six pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  In May 2020, ENHERTU receivedBTDfrom the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have received two or more prior regimens including trastuzumab, andOrphan Drug Designationfor gastric cancer, including gastroesophageal junction cancer. In March 2018, ENHERTU received a SAKIGAKE designation for potential use in the same HER2 positive patient population and asupplemental New Drug Application (NDA) was submitted to the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for approval in April 2020.  In May 2020, ENHERTU also received aBTDfor the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.  About the Collaboration between Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca In March 2019, Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is solely responsible for the manufacturing and supply.  U.S. FDA-Approved Indication for ENHERTU ENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.  This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY ●　Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms. ●　Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.  ContraindicationsNone.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interstitial Lung Disease / PneumonitisSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).  Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).  Neutropenia Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  Left Ventricular Dysfunction Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.  Embryo-Fetal ToxicityENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  Adverse ReactionsThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.  ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).  Use in Specific Populations ●　Pregnancy:ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. ●　Lactation:There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. ●　Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility: ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility. ●　Pediatric Use:Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. ●　Geriatric Use:Of the 234 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). ●　Hepatic Impairment:In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.

The trial evaluated patients with HER2 positive unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma that had progressed following two or more treatment regimens including trastuzumab and chemotherapy. These results were presented today during the American Society of Clinical Oncology Virtual Scientific Program (#ASCO20) and simultaneously published online inThe New England Journal of MedicineOpen new window..  Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide with a five-year survival rate of five percent for metastatic disease.[1]Approximately one in five gastric cancers are considered HER2 positive.[2]  The confirmed ORR, also called a tumor response rate, which was assessed by independent central review, was 42.9% with ENHERTU monotherapy (6.4 mg/kg) (p<0.0001; CI: 33.8-52.3) compared to 12.5% with investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel or irinotecan). Ten complete responses and 41 partial responses were seen in patients treated with ENHERTU versus no complete responses and seven partial responses seen in patients treated with chemotherapy.  Patients treated with ENHERTU had a 41% reduction in the risk of death compared to patients treated with chemotherapy (based on a hazard ratio [HR] of 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.39-0.88; p=0.0097) at a pre-specified interim analysis. The median OS was 12.5 months versus 8.4 months with chemotherapy. The estimated OS rate at one year with ENHERTU was 52.1% and 28.9% with the chemotherapy arm.  The safety and tolerability profile of ENHERTU in DESTINY-Gastric01 was consistent with that observed in the phase 1 gastric trial and previously reported ENHERTU trials. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (51.2%), anemia (37.6%), decreased white blood cell count (20.8%) and decreased appetite (16.8%). There were 12 cases (9.6%) of confirmed treatment-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis as determined by an independent review. The majority were grade 1 or 2 with two grade 3, one grade 4 and no grade 5 (ILD-related deaths).  “Once patients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer progress following initial treatment with an anti-HER2 regimen, there are limited treatment options and no approved HER2 targeted therapies,” said Kohei Shitara, MD, Chief of Department of Gastrointestinal Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital East, Chiba, Japan and principal investigator in the phase 2 DESTINY-Gastric01 trial. “Based on the compelling results of the DESTINY-Gastric01 trial, ENHERTU has the potential to become a new standard of care for these patients.”  ENHERTU showed a confirmed disease control rate (DCR) of 85.7% (CI: 78.1-91.5) versus 62.5% (CI: 48.5-75.1) and a median confirmed duration of response (DoR) of 11.3 months (CI: 5.6-NE) versus 3.9 months (CI: 3.9-4.9) as compared to chemotherapy.  “ENHERTU is the first HER2 directed therapy to show an improvement in overall survival for patients with previously-treated HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer,” said Antoine Yver, MD, MSc, Executive Vice President and Global Head, Oncology Research and Development, Daiichi Sankyo. “These data are encouraging and meaningful since patients with advanced gastric cancer have limited therapeutic options once they progress and face markedly high mortality rates. We are working with regulatory authorities to bring ENHERTU to patients with metastatic gastric cancer as quickly as possible.”  “In DESTINY-Gastric01, the response rate was more than three times higher with ENHERTU versus chemotherapy. Additionally, more than half of patients treated with ENHERTU were alive at one year compared to less than a third with chemotherapy,” said José Baselga, MD, PhD, Executive Vice President, R&D Oncology, AstraZeneca. “In addition to the impressive results we saw in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer in DESTINY-Breast01, these results in gastric cancer help further define the role of ENHERTU in transforming patient outcomes across multiple HER2 targetable cancers.”  Summary of Results:i  Efficacy Measure ENHERTUMonotherapyii Investigator’s Choice of Chemotherapy(Irinotecan or Paclitaxel)  n=119 n=56 Confirmed ORR (%)(95% CI %)iii, iv,v 42.90%(33.8-52.3; p<0.0001) 12.50%(5.2-24.1) CR (%) 8.40% 0% PR (%) 34.50% 12.50% SD (%) 42.90% 50.00% Confirmed DCR (%)vi(95% CI, %) 85.7% (78.1-91.5) 62.5% (48.5-75.1) Confirmed Median DoR (months)(95% CI) 11.3 months(5.6- NE) 3.9 months(3.0-4.9)  i Data cutoff was November 8, 2019.PR, partial response; SD, stable disease ii ENHERTU 6.4mg/kg iii As assessed by independent central review. iv ORR is (CR  + PR) v Confirmed ORR represents responses confirmed by a follow-up scan ≥4 weeks after initial CR/PR; unconfirmed ORR is the primary endpoint of the trial [51.3% (95% CI 41.9–60.5) versus 14.3% (95% CI 6.4–26.2); p<0.0001]. Both confirmed and unconfirmed ORR were assessed by independent central review. vi DCR is (CR + PR + SD)  ENHERTU was recently granted aBreakthrough Therapy Designation(BTD) in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have received two or more prior regimens including trastuzumab. Asupplemental new drug application(sNDA) was submitted to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) based on these data and will undergo expedited review as a SAKIGAKE-designated medicine for this potential indication.  About HER2 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. In some tumors, HER2 overexpression is associated with a specific HER2 gene alteration known as amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poorer prognosis.[3]  About Gastric Cancer Gastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer mortality with a five-year survival rate of five percent for metastatic disease; there were approximately one million new cases reported in 2018 and 783,000 deaths.1  Approximately one in five gastric cancers are HER2 positive.2 Gastric cancer is usually diagnosed in the advanced stage, but even when diagnosed in earlier stages of the disease the survival rate remains modest.[4]Recommended first-line treatment for HER2 positive advanced or metastatic gastric cancer is combination chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 medicine, which has been shown to improve outcomes when added to chemotherapy.[5]For gastric cancer that progresses on first line treatment, trastuzumab has not shown any further benefit and there are no other approved HER2 targeting medicines.5  DESTINY-Gastric01 DESTINY-Gastric01Open new window.is an open-label, multi-center, randomized, pivotal phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU in a primary cohort of 188 patients from Japan and South Korea with HER2 expressing advanced gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (defined as IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+) who had progressed on two or more prior treatment regimens including fluoropyrimidine (5-FU), platinum chemotherapy and trastuzumab. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive ENHERTU or investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel or irinotecan monotherapy). Patients were treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or chemotherapy.  The primary endpoint of the study is ORR, as assessed by independent central review. ORR, or tumor response rate, represents the percentage of patients whose disease decreased and/or disappears. Overall survival was a key secondary endpoint to be statistically evaluated hierarchically if the primary endpoint was statistically significant. Other secondary endpoints include PFS, DoR, DCR and confirmed ORR assessed in those responses confirmed by a follow-up scan of at least 4 weeks after initial independent central review.  About ENHERTU ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the U.S. only; trastuzumab deruxtecan outside the U.S.) is a HER2 directed ADC and is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC Scientific platform.  ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is comprised of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker.  ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) is approved in the U.S. and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens based on the DESTINY-Breast01 trial.  ENHERTU has not been approved in the EU, or countries outside of Japan and the U.S., for any indication. It is an investigational agent globally for various indications. Safety and effectiveness have not been established for the subject proposed use.  About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program A comprehensive development program for ENHERTU is underway globally with six pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 cancers including breast, gastric, and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  In May 2020, ENHERTU receivedBTDfrom the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have received two or more prior regimens including trastuzumab, andOrphan Drug DesignationOpen new window.for gastric cancer, including gastroesophageal junction cancer. In March 2018, ENHERTU received a SAKIGAKE designation for potential use in the same HER2 positive patient population and asNDAwas submitted to the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for approval in April 2020.  In May 2020, ENHERTU also received aBTDfor the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.  About the Collaboration between Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca In March 2019, Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is solely responsible for the manufacturing and supply.  U.S. FDA-Approved Indication for ENHERTU ENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.  This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY ●　Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms. ●　Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.  ContraindicationsNone.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interstitial Lung Disease / PneumonitisSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).  Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).  Neutropenia Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  Left Ventricular Dysfunction Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.  Embryo-Fetal ToxicityENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  Adverse ReactionsThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.  ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).  Use in Specific Populations ●　Pregnancy:ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. ●　Lactation:There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. ●　Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility: ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility. ●　Pediatric Use:Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. ●　Geriatric Use:Of the 234 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). ●　Hepatic Impairment:In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.

These results were presented today at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology Virtual Scientific Program (#ASCO20).  Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and second most common cause of cancer death worldwide.[1]There are currently no medicines approved to specifically treat HER2 positive colorectal cancer, which affects approximately two to five percent of patients with colorectal cancer.[2]  The primary endpoint of confirmed objective response rate (ORR), also called a tumor response rate, which was assessed by independent central review, showed 45.3% of patients with HER2 positive advanced colorectal cancer (defined as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+) treated with ENHERTU monotherapy (6.4mg/kg) achieved a tumor response. A disease control rate (DCR) of 83.0% was observed with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 6.9 months. Median duration of response (DoR) and overall survival (OS) have not yet been reached at the time of data cut-off.  The overall safety and tolerability profile of ENHERTU in DESTINY-CRC01 was consistent with that seen in previously reported ENHERTU trials. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (25.6%) and anemia (14.1%). There were five cases (6.4%) of treatment-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis determined by an independent adjudication committee. Two were grade 2 and one was grade 3. Two deaths (grade 5) were determined to be due to ILD.  “Understanding new ways we can treat patients with colorectal cancer, such as targeting HER2, is critical as patients have few remaining treatment options once progression occurs in the advanced disease setting,” said Salvatore Siena, MD, Professor of Medical Oncology, Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, Università degli Studi di Milano, and Niguarda Cancer Center Milan, Italy and principal investigator of the DESTINY-CRC01 trial. “The results from DESTINY-CRC01 in patients with HER2 positive advanced colorectal cancer are striking and warrant further research, especially considering many of these patients have had numerous prior therapies.”  Prespecified exploratory analysis evaluated ORR in subgroups, including patients previously treated with a prior anti-HER2 regimen (n=16). In these patients an ORR of 43.8% was seen.  Patients were treated with a median of four prior lines of therapy (range, 2-11) with all patients having received prior chemotherapy treatment with irinotecan and oxaliplatin. The median treatment duration was 4.8 months (range, 1-11). As of data cut-off on August 9, 2019, 38.5% (30 out of 78) remained on treatment across all cohorts.  “Metastatic colorectal cancer has a devastating prognosis and there have been limited treatment advances following progression on first-line treatment and there are no therapies approved that specifically target HER2,” said Antoine Yver, MD, MSc, Executive Vice President and Global Head, Oncology Research and Development, Daiichi Sankyo. “We are encouraged by the tumor response rates seen in patients with previously-treated advanced colorectal cancer and we will continue to explore the potential of ENHERTU to address this unmet medical need.”  “These clinically meaningful and durable responses in patients with advanced HER2 positive colorectal cancer support our belief that HER2 is an important target in this disease,” said José Baselga, MD, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “ENHERTU has now demonstrated impressive clinical activity in four different cancer settings, reinforcing the potential of this remarkable medicine to transform patient outcomes across a range of HER2 targetable tumors.”  Summary of Results   Efficacy Measure Total Evaluable in Primary Cohort (n=53)i,ii ORR (%) (95% CI)iii,iv 45.3% (31.6 - 59.6) ORR (previously HER2 treated) (%) 43.8% (19.8 -70.1) CR (%) 1.9% PR (%) 43.4% SD (%) 37.7% DCR (%) (95% CI)v 83.0% (70.2 - 91.9) Median DoR (months) (95% CI) Not reached (4.2 months - NE) Median PFS (months) (95% CI) 6.9 months (4.1 months - NE) Median OS (months) (95% CI) Not reached (0.74 months - NE)  CI, confidence interval; CR, complete response; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease; NE, not estimable i ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg ii Primary cohort included patients with HER2-positive disease (defined as IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+). iii As assessed by independent central review. iv ORR is (CR + PR) v DCR is (CR + PR + SD)  Two exploratory cohorts enrolled patients with tumors with lower levels of HER2 expression (HER2 IHC 2+/ISH- and HER2 IHC 1+, respectively). There were no responses seen in these two exploratory cohorts.  About HER2 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including breast, gastric, lung and colorectal cancers. In some tumors, HER2 overexpression is associated with a specific HER2 gene alteration known as amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poorer prognosis.[3]  HER2 overexpression and amplification occurs in approximately two to five percent of all patients with colorectal cancer.2 Research indicates that HER2 amplification may be associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy and shorter survival.[4],[5]  About Colorectal Cancer Colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer in women and the third most common cancer in men worldwide.1 In 2018, more than 1.8 million people worldwide received colorectal cancer diagnoses and approximately 880,800 died from the disease.1 Approximately 25% of patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis, meaning the disease has spread to distant organs, and about 50% of patients with colorectal cancer will eventually develop metastases.5  About DESTINY-CRC01 DESTINY-CRC01Open new window.is a global, phase 2, open-label, multicenter, trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU in patients (n=78) with HER2 expressing, unresectable and/or metastatic colorectal cancer. DESTINY-CRC01 excluded patients with a mutation in the RAS or BRAF gene. The primary cohort of the trial enrolled patients (n=53) with HER2 positive (defined as IHC 3+ or IHC2+/ISH+) disease. The primary endpoint of the trial is confirmed ORR, assessed by independent central review, in the primary cohort. ORR, or tumor response rate, represents the percentage of patients whose disease decreased and/or disappeared. Secondary endpoints include DCR, DoR, PFS, and OS. Two additional exploratory cohorts enrolled patients whose tumor had lower levels of HER2 expression (HER2 IHC 2+/ISH, n=7, and HER2 IHC 1+, n=18, respectively).  About ENHERTU ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the U.S. only; trastuzumab deruxtecan outside the U.S.) is a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) and is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC Scientific platform.  ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is comprised of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker.  ENHERTU is approved in the U.S. and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens based on the DESTINY-Breast01 trial. ENHERTU has not been approved in the EU, or countries outside of Japan and the United States, for any indication. It is an investigational agent globally for various indications. Safety and effectiveness have not been established for the subject proposed use.  About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program A comprehensive development program for ENHERTU is underway globally with six pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  In May 2020, ENHERTU receivedBreakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have received two or more prior regimens including trastuzumab, andOrphan Drug Designationfor gastric cancer, including gastroesophageal junction cancer. In March 2018, ENHERTU received a SAKIGAKE designation for potential use in the same HER2 positive patient population and asupplemental New Drug Application (NDA) was submitted to the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for approval in April 2020.  In May 2020, ENHERTU also received aBTDfor the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a HER2 mutation and with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy.  About the Collaboration between Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca In March 2019, Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is solely responsible for the manufacturing and supply.  U.S. FDA-Approved Indication for ENHERTU ENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.  This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.   WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY ●　Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms. ●　Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.  ContraindicationsNone.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interstitial Lung Disease / PneumonitisSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).  Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).  Neutropenia Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  Left Ventricular Dysfunction Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.  Embryo-Fetal ToxicityENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  Adverse ReactionsThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.  ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).

Marketing approval of ENHERTU by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) in March 2020 was based on the results of the open-label, single-arm, pivotal phase 2DESTINY-Breast01Open new window.trial that demonstrated a confirmed objective response rate of 64.1% [95% CI: 56.3-71.3] in the response evaluable set of 107 of 167 patients, which included 26 Japanese women, at a data cut-off of March 21, 2019. Data from the DESTINY-Breast01 trial were published inThe New England Journal of MedicineOpen new window..  “Now patients in Japan with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer who progress following treatment with at least two HER2 directed therapies and chemotherapy have access to ENHERTU, an important new medicine that may transform the way these patients are treated. We are proud of how quickly we have delivered ENHERTU, making it available only four years after treating the first patient in Japan,” said Hideaki Noji, Vice President, Head of Specialty Marketing in Japan, Daiichi Sankyo. “ENHERTU also represents the second innovative oncology medicine to be launched in Japan from the oncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo in the past year, another milestone we are honored to have achieved.”  Safety and efficacy of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) in patients without prior trastuzumab, taxane and trastuzumab emtansine treatment have not been established. ENHERTU is approved in Japan with a Warning for Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD). As cases of ILD, including fatal cases, have occurred in ENHERTU-treated patients, ENHERTU is to be used in close collaboration with a respiratory disease expert. Closely observe patients during therapy by monitoring for early signs or symptoms of ILD (such as dyspnea, cough or fever) and regularly perform peripheral artery oxygen saturation (SpO2) tests, chest X-ray scans and chest CT scans. If abnormalities are observed, discontinue administration of ENHERTU, and take appropriate measures such as corticosteroid administration. Prior to initiation of ENHERTU therapy, perform a chest CT scan and interview to confirm the absence of any comorbidity or history of ILD with the patient, and carefully consider the eligibility of the patient for ENHERTU therapy.  Adverse reactions (from ENHERTU Japan Prescribing Information) occurred in 182 of 184 patients (98.9%) who received ENHERTU. The most common adverse reactions were nausea in 140 patients (76.1%), alopecia in 85 patients (46.2%), fatigue in 81 patients (44.0%), vomiting in 78 patients (42.4%), neutrophil count decreased in 55 patients (29.9%), decreased appetite in 52 patients (28.3%), anemia in 40 patients (21.7%) and diarrhea in 40 patients (21.7%). Overall incidence of ILD was 8.2%. ILD occurred in 23% of Japanese patients (7 out of 30) with no grade 3 or above events including no ILD-related deaths.  About ENHERTU ENHERTU (trastuzumab deruxtecan outside the U.S.; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the U.S. only), is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC Scientific platform.  ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is comprised of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker.  ENHERTU has been approved for use only in the U.S. and Japan. ENHERTU has not been approved in the EU, or countries outside of Japan and the United States, for any indication. It is an investigational agent globally for various indications.  About the ENHERTU Clinical Development Program A comprehensive development program for ENHERTU is underway globally with six pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 targetable cancers including breast, gastric and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  About the Collaboration between Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca In March 2019, Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is solely responsible for the manufacturing and supply.  U.S. FDA-Approved Indication for ENHERTU ENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.  This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.   WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY ●　Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms. ●　Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.  ContraindicationsNone.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interstitial Lung Disease / PneumonitisSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).  Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).  Neutropenia Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  Left Ventricular Dysfunction Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.  Embryo-Fetal ToxicityENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  Adverse ReactionsThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.  ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).  Use in Specific Populations Pregnancy:ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Lactation:There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. Females and Males of ReproductivePotential: Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility: ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility. Pediatric Use:Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. Geriatric Use:Of the 234 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). Hepatic Impairment:In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.

NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, and prognosis is particularly poor for patients with metastatic disease as only about six to 10 percent will be alive five years after diagnosis.[1],[2]Approximately two to four percent of patients with NSCLC have a HER2 mutation.[3],[4]  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) BTD is designed to accelerate the development and regulatory review of potential new medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition and address a significant unmet medical need. The new medicine needs to have shown encouraging preliminary clinical results that demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint over available medicines.  “We are encouraged by the promising evidence of activity seen with ENHERTU in patients with advanced lung cancer and a HER2 mutation,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “We look forward to working closely with the FDA on the potential for ENHERTU to become the first HER2 directed therapy approved for non-small cell lung cancer.”  “Today’s news is very welcome as we continue to evaluate the potential of ENHERTU to help patients with this devastating type of lung cancer,” said José Baselga, MD, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “Targeted treatments and immunotherapies are demonstrating tremendous advancements, but there remains an unmet medical need for patients with HER2 mutations who are not benefiting from such therapies or for those whose cancer continues to progress.”  The FDA granted BTD based on data from ongoing phase 2DESTINY-Lung01Open new window.trial currently assessing ENHERTU, a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC), in patients with HER2 mutant metastatic NSCLC and data from the phase 1 trial published inCancer DiscoveryOpen new window.. An interim analysis from DESTINY-Lung01 will be presented at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO20) Virtual Scientific Program.  The overall safety and tolerability profile of ENHERTU in the ongoing DESTINY-Lung01 trial is consistent with that seen in the phase 1 trial. The most common adverse events to date (n=42) are gastrointestinal and hematological including nausea, alopecia, anemia, decreased appetite and decreased neutrophil count. There have been five cases of drug-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis in patients with HER2 mutant NSCLC, all of which were grade 2. There have been no ILD-related deaths.  This is the third BTD granted for ENHERTU in the U.S., and the fourth expedited regulatory designation received globally. Last week, ENHERTU receivedBTDin patients with HER2 positive unresectable gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have received two or more prior regimens including trastuzumab.  ENHERTU recently received accelerated approval in theU.SOpen new window.. and approval inJapanOpen new window.under the conditional early approval system for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens.  About HER2 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including gastric, breast and lung cancers. In some tumors, HER2 overexpression is associated with a specific HER2 gene alteration known as amplification and is often associated with aggressive disease and poorer prognosis.[5]  Other HER2 gene alterations (called HER2 mutations) have been identified in NSCLC, specifically adenocarcinomas, as distinct molecular targets.4,[6]Approximately two to four percent of patients with NSCLC have HER2 mutations, which have been independently associated with cancer cell growth and poor prognosis.3,4 About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women and accounts for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.[7]In the U.S., it is estimated that 228,820 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed in 2020 and more than 135,000 people will die from the disease.[8]  NSCLC accounts for approximately 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancers.[9]For patients with metastatic disease, prognosis is particularly poor, as only six to 10 percent will be alive five years after diagnosis.1 The introduction of targeted therapies and checkpoint inhibitors in recent years has improved the treatment landscape for patients with advanced NSCLC; however, new approaches are needed for those who are not eligible for available treatments, or whose cancer continues to progress.[10]Currently, no medicine is specifically approved for patients with HER2 mutant NSCLC.  About DESTINY-Lung01 DESTINY-Lung01Open new window.is a global, phase 2, open-label, multicenter, two-cohort study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU in 170 patients with HER2 mutant (n=90) or HER2 overexpressing (defined as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+, n=80) unresectable and metastatic non-squamous NSCLC whose cancer has progressed after one or more systemic therapies including chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy or immunotherapy. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR). Key secondary endpoints include duration of response, disease control rate, progression free survival, and overall survival.

WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY ●　Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms. ●　Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.  ContraindicationsNone.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interstitial Lung Disease / PneumonitisSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).  Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).  Neutropenia Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  Left Ventricular Dysfunction Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.  Embryo-Fetal ToxicityENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  Adverse ReactionsThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.  ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).  Use in Specific Populations ●Pregnancy:ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. ●Lactation:There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. ●Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility: ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility. ●Pediatric Use:Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. ●Geriatric Use:Of the 234 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). ●Hepatic Impairment:In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.

Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer mortality with a five-year survival rate of five percent for metastatic disease.[1],[2]Approximately one in five gastric cancers are considered HER2 positive.[3]  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) BTD is designed to accelerate the development and regulatory review of potential new medicines that are intended to treat a serious condition and address a significant unmet medical need. The new medicine needs to have shown encouraging preliminary clinical results that demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint over available medicines.  “DESTINY-Gastric01 represents the first randomized trial of ENHERTU to demonstrate clinically meaningful and statistically significant results, including objective response and survival increases compared to physician’s choice of chemotherapy,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, FOPQ, Senior Vice President, Global Head, Oncology Development, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “We are thrilled that the FDA has granted ENHERTU a second Breakthrough Therapy Designation.”  “For patients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer, current therapy options are limited, and for those who progress, there no approved HER2 targeted medicines,” said José Baselga, MD, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “We look forward to working with the FDA to further explore the potential of ENHERTU to become an important new treatment and the first antibody drug conjugate for this devastating disease.” The FDA granted the BTD based on data from the pivotal phase 2DESTINY-Gastric01Open new window.trial and data from the phase 1 trial published inThe Lancet OncologyOpen new window.. In DESTINY-Gastric01, patients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer who progressed after two previous regimens treated with ENHERTU, a HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC), demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS) compared to patients treated with investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (irinotecan or paclitaxel monotherapy).  The overall safety and tolerability profile of ENHERTU in DESTINY-Gastric01 was consistent with that seen in the phase 1 trial in which the most common adverse events (≥30 percent, any grade) were hematologic and gastrointestinal including neutrophil count decrease, anemia, nausea and decreased appetite. There were cases of drug-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, the majority of which were grade 1 and 2 with two grade 3 and one grade 4. No ILD-related deaths (grade 5) occurred in patients with gastric cancer in the phase 1 trial or in the DESTINY-Gastric01 trial.  The research results of DESTINY-Gastric01 will be presented at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO20) Virtual Scientific Program.  ENHERTU received SAKIGAKE designation in March 2018 by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for potential use in the same HER2 positive gastric cancer patient population and was recently submitted to theJapan MHLWfor approval. This is the second Breakthrough Therapy Designation granted for ENHERTU in the US, and the third expedited regulatory designation received globally.  ENHERTU recently received accelerated approval in theU.S.and approval inJapanunder the early conditional approval system for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens.  About HER2HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including gastric, breast and lung cancers. In some tumors, HER2 overexpression is associated with a specific HER2 gene alteration known as HER2 amplification and is often associated aggressive disease and poorer prognosis.[4]  About Gastric CancerGastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer mortality; there were approximately one million new cases reported in 2018 and 783,000 deaths.1 In the U.S., it is estimated that 27,600 new cases of stomach cancer will be diagnosed in 2020 and more than 11,000 people will die from the disease.[5] Approximately one in five gastric cancers are HER2 positive.3 Gastric cancer is usually diagnosed in the advanced stage, but even when diagnosed in earlier stages of the disease the survival rate remains modest.[6]Recommended first-line treatment for HER2 positive advanced or metastatic gastric cancer is combination chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 medicine, which has been shown to improve outcomes when added to chemotherapy.[7]For gastric cancer that progresses on first-line treatment, trastuzumab has not shown any further benefit and there are no other approved HER2 targeting medicines.7  DESTINY-Gastric01DESTINY-Gastric01Open new window.is a pivotal phase 2, open-label, multi-center trial assessing the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU in a primary cohort of 188 patients from Japan and South Korea with HER2 expressing advanced gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (defined as IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+) who have progressed on two or more prior treatment regimens including fluoropyrimidine (5-FU), platinum chemotherapy and trastuzumab. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive ENHERTU or investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel or irinotecan monotherapy). Patients were treated with ENHERTU 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study is ORR as assessed by an independent review committee. Secondary endpoints include OS, progression-free survival, duration of response, disease control rate and time to treatment failure as well as pharmacokinetic and safety endpoints.  About ENHERTUENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the U.S. only; trastuzumab deruxtecan outside the U.S.) is a HER2 directed ADC and is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC Scientific platform.  ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, ENHERTU is comprised of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker.  ENHERTU has been approved for use only in the U.S. and Japan. ENHERTU has not been approved in the EU, or countries outside of Japan and the United States, for any indication. It is an investigational agent globally for various indications. Safety and effectiveness have not been established for the subject proposed use.  About the ENHERTU Clinical Development ProgramA comprehensive development program for ENHERTU is underway globally with six pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENHERTU monotherapy across multiple HER2 driven cancers including breast, gastric and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  About the Collaboration between Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZenecaIn March 2019, Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is solely responsible for the manufacturing and supply.  U.S. FDA-Approved Indication for ENHERTUENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.  This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY ●　Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms. ●　Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.  ContraindicationsNone.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interstitial Lung Disease / PneumonitisSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).  Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).  NeutropeniaSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  Left Ventricular DysfunctionPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.  Embryo-Fetal ToxicityENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  Adverse ReactionsThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.  ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).

Trastuzumab deruxtecan has previously received SAKIGAKE designation for this second potential indication and will receive an expedited review time of six months. Currently, there are no HER2 directed treatment options approved for patients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer who have progressed after trastuzumab.  \"Today’s submission by Daiichi Sankyo brings us closer to bringing trastuzumab deruxtecan to a population of patients with unmet medical need in Japan,” said Wataru Takasaki, PhD, Executive Officer, Head of R&D Division in Japan, Daiichi Sankyo. “If approved, trastuzumab deruxtecan has the potential to meaningfully advance the treatment of patients with HER2 positive metastatic gastric cancer as the first ever antibody drug conjugate approved to treat this type of cancer.”  The Japan sNDA is based on data from the pivotal phase 2DESTINY-Gastric01Open new window.trial and phase 1 trial published inThe Lancet OncologyOpen new window.. In DESTINY-Gastric01, patients treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by an independent review committee as well as in overall survival (OS) compared to patients treated with investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (irinotecan or paclitaxel monotherapy). The full results of DESTINY-Gastric01 will be presented at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting.  The overall safety and tolerability profile of trastuzumab deruxtecan in DESTINY-Gastric01 was consistent with that seen in the phase 1 trial in which the most common adverse events (≥30 percent, any grade) were hematologic and gastrointestinal including neutrophil count decrease, anemia, nausea and decreased appetite. There were cases of drug-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, the majority of which were grade 1 and 2 with two grade 3 and one grade 4. No ILD-related deaths (grade 5) occurred in patients with gastric cancer in the phase 1 trial or in the DESTINY-Gastric01 trial.  Accelerated approval in theU.S.and approval inJapanunder the conditional early approval system were recently received for trastuzumab deruxtecan for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 based regimens.  About HER2 HER2 is a cell growth-promoting tyrosine kinase receptor protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including gastric, breast and lung cancers. HER2 overexpression is associated with a specific HER2 gene alteration known as HER2 amplification and is often associated aggressive disease and poorer prognosis.[1]  About Gastric Cancer Gastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer mortality; there were approximately one million new cases reported in 2018 and 783,000 deaths.[2]Incidence rates for gastric cancer are markedly higher in eastern Asia, where approximately half of all cases occur.8 South Korea and Japan have the first and third highest incidence rates of gastric cancer worldwide, respectively; in 2018, the age-standardized rate in Japan was 27.5 per 100,000 and in South Korea it was 39.6 per 100,000.[3]  Approximately one in five gastric cancers are HER2 positive.[4]Gastric cancer is usually diagnosed in the advanced stage, but even when diagnosed in earlier stages of the disease the survival rate remains modest.[5]Recommended first-line treatment for HER2 positive advanced or metastatic gastric cancer is combination chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 medicine, which has been shown to improve outcomes when added to chemotherapy.[6]For gastric cancer that progresses on first line treatment, trastuzumab has not shown any further benefit and there are no other approved HER2 targeting medicines.6  About DESTINY-Gastric01 DESTINY-Gastric01Open new window.is a pivotal phase 2, open-label, multi-center study assessing the safety and efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan in 189 patients from Japan and South Korea with HER2 expressing advanced gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (defined as IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+) who have progressed on two or more prior regimens including fluoropyrimidine (5-FU), platinum chemotherapy and trastuzumab. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive trastuzumab deruxtecan or investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel or irinotecan monotherapy). Patients were treated with trastuzumab deruxtecan 6.4 mg/kg once every three weeks or chemotherapy given on the same schedule. The primary endpoint of the study is ORR. Secondary endpoints include OS, progression-free survival, duration of response, disease control rate and time to treatment failure.  About Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Trastuzumab deruxtecan (formerly known as DS-8201; trastuzumab deruxtecan outside the U.S.; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the U.S. only) is a HER2 directed ADC and is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC Scientific platform.  ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, trastuzumab deruxtecan is comprised of a HER2 monoclonal antibody attached to a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker.  Trastuzumab deruxtecan has not been approved in the EU, or countries outside of Japan and the United States, for any indication. It is an investigational agent globally for various indications. Safety and effectiveness have not been established for the subject proposed use.  About the Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Clinical Development Program A comprehensive development program for trastuzumab deruxtecan is underway globally with six pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan monotherapy across multiple HER2 driven cancers including breast, gastric, colorectal and lung cancers. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  About the Collaboration between Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca In March 2019, Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize trastuzumab deruxtecan worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo is solely responsible for the manufacturing and supply.  U.S. FDA-Approved Indication for ENHERTU ENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.  This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.   WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY ●　Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms. ●　Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception. Contraindications None.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSInterstitial Lung Disease / PneumonitisSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).  Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).  Neutropenia Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  Left Ventricular Dysfunction Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.  Embryo-Fetal ToxicityENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  Adverse ReactionsThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.  ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).  Use in Specific Populations ●Pregnancy:ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. ●Lactation:There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose. ●Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility: ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility. ●Pediatric Use:Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients. ●Geriatric Use:Of the 234 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). ●Hepatic Impairment:In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.

Approval of ENHERTU® by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) is based on the results of the open-label, single-arm, pivotal phase 2 DESTINY-Breast01 trial of ENHERTU® (5.4 mg/kg) monotherapy in 184 female patients (including 30 Japanese women) with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer. A confirmed objective response rate of 64.1% [95% CI: 56.3-71.3] was demonstrated in the response evaluable set of 107 of 167 patients, which was the primary endpoint of the study.[1]Twenty-six women from Japan were included in the objective response rate analysis, with a data cut-off of March 21, 2019.  “Our researchers in Japan have worked diligently on our ADC technology and we are excited to bring ENHERTU®, the first of many ADCs we have in development, to patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer in Japan. Results seen with ENHERTU® are impressive as most women benefited from treatment with durable responses lasting a median duration of more than 14 months,” said Wataru Takasaki, PhD, Corporate Officer, Head of Oncology Function and Head of R&D Division in Japan, Daiichi Sankyo. “ENHERTU® also represents the second innovative treatment to be approved in Japan from our oncology pipeline within the past year, a milestone we are extremely proud of as we work to transform science into meaningful treatments for patients with cancer.”  Efficacy and safety of ENHERTU® in patients without prior trastuzumab, taxane and trastuzumab emtansine treatment have not been established. ENHERTU® is approved in Japan with a Warning for Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD). As cases of ILD, including fatal cases, have occurred in ENHERTU®-treated patients, ENHERTU® is to be used in close collaboration with a respiratory disease expert. Closely observe patients during therapy by monitoring for early signs or symptoms of ILD (such as dyspnea, cough or fever) and regularly perform peripheral artery oxygen saturation (SpO2) tests, chest X-ray scans and chest CT scans. If abnormalities are observed, discontinue administration of ENHERTU®, and take appropriate measures such as corticosteroid administration. Prior to initiation of ENHERTU® therapy, perform a chest CT scan and interview to confirm the absence of any comorbidity or history of ILD with the patient, and carefully consider the eligibility of the patient for ENHERTU® therapy.  Adverse reactions occurred in 182 of 184 patients (98.9%) who received ENHERTU®. The most common adverse reactions were nausea in 140 patients (76.1%), alopecia in 85 patients (46.2%), fatigue in 81 patients (44.0%), vomiting in 78 patients (42.4%), neutrophil count decreased in 55 patients (29.9%), decreased appetite in 52 patients (28.3%), anemia in 40 patients (21.7%) and diarrhea in 40 patients (21.7%). Overall incidence of ILD was 8.2%. ILD occurred in 23% of Japanese patients (7 out of 30) with no grade 3 or above events including no ILD-related deaths.  About HER2 Positive Breast CancerApproximately one in five breast cancers are HER2 positive.[2],[3]Despite recent improvements and approvals of new medicines, there remain significant clinical needs for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.[4],[5]This disease remains incurable with patients eventually progressing after available treatment.4,5  About HER2HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein found on the surface of some cancer cells that is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer.[6]To be considered HER2 positive, tumor cancer cells are usually tested by one of two methods: immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). IHC test results are reported as: 0, IHC 1+, IHC 2+, or IHC 3+.6 A finding of IHC 3+ and/or FISH amplification is considered positive.6  About DESTINY-Breast01DESTINY-Breast01Open new window.is a pivotal phase 2, single-arm, open-label, global, multicenter, two-part trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ENHERTU® in 184 female patients with HER2 positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). The primary endpoint of the trial is objective response rate, as determined by independent central review. Secondary objectives include pharmacokinetics, duration of response, disease control rate, clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival, overall survival and safety.  About the Clinical Development ProgramA comprehensive development program for ENHERTU® is underway globally with five pivotal trials in HER2 expressing metastatic breast and gastric cancer, including a trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer and low levels of HER2 expression (HER2 low). Phase 2 trials are underway for HER2 expressing advanced colorectal cancer as well as metastatic non-squamous HER2 overexpressing or HER2 mutated non-small cell lung cancer. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  ENHERTU® has previously received SAKIGAKE designation for the treatment of advanced HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer by Japan’s MHLW.  About ENHERTU®ENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan in Japan and other regions of the world; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki in the U.S.), is the lead ADC in the oncology portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC Scientific platform.

Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU® and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU® may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU® until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU® until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU® until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  Left Ventricular DysfunctionPatients treated with ENHERTU® may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU®. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU®, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU® has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU® and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU® if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU®. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU® and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU® and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU®. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU® at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU® and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU®. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU® in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.  Embryo-Fetal ToxicityENHERTU® can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU®. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU®. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU® and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU®.  Adverse ReactionsThe safety of ENHERTU® was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU® 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU® was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU®. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU® were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.  ENHERTU® was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU®. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU®. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).  Use in Specific Populations ●　Pregnancy: ENHERTU® can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU® is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU®. ●　Lactation: There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU® in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU® and for 7 months after the last dose. ●　Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU®. Contraception: Females: ENHERTU® can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU® and for at least 7 months following the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU® and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility: ENHERTU® may impair male reproductive function and fertility. ●　Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU® have not been established in pediatric patients. ●　Geriatric Use: Of the 234 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU® 5.4 mg/kg, 26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%). ●　Hepatic Impairment: In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  This press release features multimedia. View the full releasehereOpen new window..  “Many patients with this aggressive form of metastatic breast cancer continue to face tumor progression despite being treated with two or more HER2 directed treatment regimens,” said Ken Keller, President and CEO, Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. “We are proud that ENHERTU is now available in the U.S. nearly four months ahead of our original goal. Physicians now have a new specifically engineered HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate with demonstrated durable efficacy that may change the way these patients are treated.”  In the single-arm, phase 2 DESTINY-Breast01 trial that included 184 female patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) achieved a confirmed objective response rate of 60.3% (n=111; 95% CI: 52.9-67.4), including a 4.3% complete response rate (n=8) and a 56.0% partial response rate (n=103).[1]The median duration of response was 14.8 months (n=111; 95% CI: 13.8-16.9).  ENHERTU is approved with a Boxed WARNING for Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/pneumonitis and Embryo-Fetal Toxicity. The safety of ENHERTU has been evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) in the DESTINY-Breast01 trial and a phase 1 trial. ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in six patients (2.6%) – two deaths already reported from the phase 1 trial and four deaths already reported in the phase 2 DESTINY-Breast01 trial. Patients and physicians should be aware of ILD/pneumonitis and patients should be actively monitored for potential signs and symptoms. If ILD/pneumonitis is identified, it should be managed as per the FDA approved Prescribing Information. Management may require dose modification or treatment discontinuation and steroid treatment. ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea, fatigue, vomiting, alopecia, constipation, decreased appetite, anemia, neutropenia, diarrhea, leukopenia, cough and thrombocytopenia.

Important Safety Information  Indication ENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.  This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY ● Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms. ● Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.  ContraindicationsNone.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSInterstitial Lung Disease / PneumonitisSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).  Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).  Neutropenia Severe neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  Left Ventricular Dysfunction Patients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.  Embryo-Fetal ToxicityENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  Adverse ReactionsThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.  ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).

Trial results showed a confirmed objective response rate (ORR) of 60.3% (n=111; 95% CI: 52.9-67.4), including a 4.3% complete response rate (n=8) and a 56.0% partial response rate (n=103).[1]A median duration of response of 14.8 months (95% CI: 13.8-16.9) was demonstrated as of August 1, 2019. In addition, a median progression free survival of 16.4 months (95% CI: 12.7-Not Estimable), based on a median follow-up of 11.1 months, was recently reported at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) and published online in The New England Journal of Medicine.[2]  ENHERTU is approved with a Boxed WARNING for Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/pneumonitis and Embryo-Fetal Toxicity. The safety of ENHERTU has been evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU (5.4 mg/kg) in the DESTINY-Breast01 trial and a phase 1 trial. ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in six patients (2.6%) – two deaths already reported from the phase 1 trial and four deaths already reported in the phase 2 DESTINY-Breast01 trial. Patients and physicians should be aware of ILD/pneumonitis and patients should be actively monitored for potential signs and symptoms. If ILD/pneumonitis is identified, it should be managed as per the FDA approved Prescribing Information. Management may require dose modification or treatment discontinuation and steroid treatment. ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea, fatigue, vomiting, alopecia, constipation, decreased appetite, anemia, neutropenia, diarrhea, leukopenia, cough and thrombocytopenia.  Patients enrolled in DESTINY-Breast01 received a median of five prior regimens (range: 2 -17) in the locally advanced/metastatic setting. All patients received prior trastuzumab, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, and 66% had prior pertuzumab.  “The approval of ENHERTU underscores that this specifically engineered HER2 directed antibody drug conjugate is delivering on its intent to establish an important new treatment for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer,” said Antoine Yver, MD, MSc, Executive Vice President and Global Head, Oncology R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “Since the beginning of our clinical trial program four years ago, we have focused on the opportunity to transform the treatment landscape for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, and we are extremely proud of how quickly we delivered ENHERTU to patients in the U.S., as ENHERTU represents one of the fastest developed biologics in oncology.”  “ENHERTU has shown impressive results in women with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, with the majority of women benefiting from treatment and the median duration of response exceeding 14 months,” said José Baselga, MD, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “With this first approval, we are proud to bring ENHERTU to patients with high unmet need and we look forward to further exploring its potential in additional settings.”  ENHERTU will be available by prescription in the U.S. within the coming weeks. Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca are committed to ensuring that patients in the U.S. who are prescribed ENHERTU can access the medication and receive necessary financial support.

Important Safety Information  IndicationENHERTU is a HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.  This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.  WARNING: INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE and EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY ●　Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including fatal cases, have been reported with ENHERTU. Monitor for and promptly investigate signs and symptoms including cough, dyspnea, fever, and other new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in all patients with Grade 2 or higher ILD/pneumonitis. Advise patients of the risk and to immediately report symptoms. ●　Exposure to ENHERTU during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.  ContraindicationsNone.  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSInterstitial Lung Disease / PneumonitisSevere, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. In clinical studies, of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU, ILD occurred in 9% of patients. Fatal outcomes due to ILD and/or pneumonitis occurred in 2.6% of patients treated with ENHERTU. Median time to first onset was 4.1 months (range: 1.2 to 8.3).  Advise patients to immediately report cough, dyspnea, fever, and/or any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of ILD. Promptly investigate evidence of ILD. Evaluate patients with suspected ILD by radiographic imaging. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist. For asymptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 0, then if resolved in ≤28 days from date of onset, maintain dose. If resolved in >28 days from date of onset, reduce dose one level. Consider corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥0.5 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). For symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2 or greater), permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Promptly initiate corticosteroid treatment as soon as ILD/pneumonitis is suspected (e.g., ≥1 mg/kg prednisolone or equivalent). Upon improvement, follow by gradual taper (e.g., 4 weeks).  NeutropeniaSevere neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, can occur in patients treated with ENHERTU. Of the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, a decrease in neutrophil count was reported in 30% of patients and 16% had Grade 3 or 4 events. Median time to first onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.3 to 18.2). Febrile neutropenia was reported in 1.7% of patients.  Monitor complete blood counts prior to initiation of ENHERTU and prior to each dose, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of neutropenia, ENHERTU may require dose interruption or reduction. For Grade 3 neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count [ANC] <1.0 to 0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less, then maintain dose. For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/L) interrupt ENHERTU until resolved to Grade 2 or less. Reduce dose by one level. For febrile neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/L and temperature >38.3ºC or a sustained temperature of ≥38ºC for more than 1 hour), interrupt ENHERTU until resolved. Reduce dose by one level.  Left Ventricular DysfunctionPatients treated with ENHERTU may be at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease has been observed with anti-HER2 therapies, including ENHERTU. In the 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received ENHERTU, two cases (0.9%) of asymptomatic LVEF decrease were reported. Treatment with ENHERTU has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <50% prior to initiation of treatment.  Assess LVEF prior to initiation of ENHERTU and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage LVEF decrease through treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU if LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed. When LVEF is >45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, continue treatment with ENHERTU. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is <10%, continue treatment with ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. When LVEF is 40-45% and absolute decrease from baseline is 10-20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF has not recovered to within 10% from baseline, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. If LVEF recovers to within 10% from baseline, resume treatment with ENHERTU at the same dose. When LVEF is <40% or absolute decrease from baseline is >20%, interrupt ENHERTU and repeat LVEF assessment within 3 weeks. If LVEF of <40% or absolute decrease from baseline of >20% is confirmed, permanently discontinue ENHERTU. Permanently discontinue ENHERTU in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure.  Embryo-Fetal ToxicityENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ENHERTU. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months after the last dose of ENHERTU.  Adverse ReactionsThe safety of ENHERTU was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 234 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who received at least one dose of ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg in DESTINY-Breast01 and Study DS8201-A-J101. ENHERTU was administered by intravenous infusion once every three weeks. The median duration of treatment was 7 months (range: 0.7 to 31).  Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving ENHERTU. Serious adverse reactions in >1% of patients who received ENHERTU were interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, vomiting, nausea, cellulitis, hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction. Fatalities due to adverse reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients including interstitial lung disease (2.6%), and the following events occurred in one patient each (0.4%): acute hepatic failure/acute kidney injury, general physical health deterioration, pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock.  ENHERTU was permanently discontinued in 9% of patients, of which ILD accounted for 6%. Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose interruption were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, and ILD. Dose reductions occurred in 18% of patients treated with ENHERTU. The most frequent adverse reactions (>2%) associated with dose reduction were fatigue, nausea, and neutropenia.  The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥20%) were nausea (79%), fatigue (59%), vomiting (47%), alopecia (46%), constipation (35%), decreased appetite (32%), anemia (31%), neutropenia (29%), diarrhea (29%), leukopenia (22%), cough (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%).  Use in Specific Populations●Pregnancy:ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if ENHERTU is used in pregnant women, or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of ENHERTU.●Lactation:There are no data regarding the presence of ENHERTU in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ENHERTU and for 7 months after the last dose.●Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:Pregnancy testing: Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of ENHERTU. Contraception: Females: ENHERTU can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 7 months following the last dose. Males: Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENHERTU and for at least 4 months following the last dose. Infertility: ENHERTU may impair male reproductive function and fertility.●Pediatric Use:Safety and effectiveness of ENHERTU have not been established in pediatric patients.●Geriatric Use:Of the 234 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with ENHERTU 5.4 mg/kg, 26% were ≥65 years and 5% were ≥75 years. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients. There was a higher incidence of Grade 3-4 adverse reactions observed in patients aged ≥65 years (53%) as compared to younger patients (42%).●Hepatic Impairment:In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, due to potentially increased exposure, closely monitor for increased toxicities related to the topoisomerase inhibitor.

The data were part of the press program at the 2019 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (#SABCS19) and simultaneously published online in The New England Journal of Medicine.  The primary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR), confirmed by independent central review, was 60.9% with DS-8201 monotherapy (5.4mg/kg) in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer who received two or more prior HER2 targeted regimens. Patients achieved a disease control rate (DCR) of 97.3% with a median duration of response (DOR) of 14.8 months (range 13.8 - 16.9) and median progression-free survival of 16.4 months (range 12.7 - not reached). The median overall survival (OS) has not yet been reached with an estimated survival rate for patients receiving DS-8201 of 86% at one year. The results were consistent across subgroups of patients.  Patients receiving DS-8201 in the DESTINY-Breast01 trial had a median of six prior regimens for metastatic disease (range 2 - 27), including ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) (100%), trastuzumab (100%), pertuzumab (65.8%), other anti-HER2 therapies (54.3%), hormone therapies (48.9%), and other systemic therapies (99.5%). Median treatment duration for DS-8201 was 10 months (range: 0.7 - 20.5 months) with a median duration of follow-up of 11.1 months (range: 0.7 - 19.9). As of data cut-off on August 1, 2019, 42.9 percent of patients remained on-treatment.  The safety and tolerability profile of DS-8201 in DESTINY-Breast01 was consistent with that observed in the phase 1 trial. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment emergent adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (20.7%), anemia (8.7%), nausea (7.6%), decreased white cell count (6.5%), decreased lymphocyte count (6.5%) and fatigue (6%). Overall, 13.6% of patients had confirmed interstitial lung disease (ILD) related to treatment as determined by an independent review. The events were primarily grade 1 or 2 (10.9%) in severity with one grade 3 (0.5%) and no grade 4 events. Four deaths (2.2%) were determined to be due to ILD.  Regulatory submission of DS-8201 for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer was recently accepted with Priority Review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A regulatory submission also has been made to Japan’s Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare (MHLW).  “These results are particularly striking as DS-8201 prompted a high level of durable tumor reduction among patients, the majority of whom had exhausted most, if not all, standard therapies for the treatment of HER2 metastatic breast cancer,” said Ian E. Krop, MD, PhD, Associate Chief, Division of Breast Oncology, Susan F. Smith Center for Women's Cancers, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “We are excited by these results and their potential to help patients with this advanced stage of breast cancer.”  “The strength of the pivotal results and the consistency with previously reported DS-8201 data further underscore that this specifically engineered HER2 targeted antibody drug conjugate is delivering on its intent of enhancing efficacy for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer,” said Antoine Yver, MD, MSc, Executive Vice President and Global Head, Oncology Research and Development, Daiichi Sankyo.  “The clinically meaningful and durable responses seen among these patients illustrate the potential of DS-8201 to establish a new standard of care,” said José Baselga, MD, PhD, Executive Vice President, R&D Oncology, AstraZeneca. “These results are impressive, as women with this advanced stage of breast cancer have already endured multiple prior therapies for HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.”  Summary of Resultsi  Efficacy measure Total evaluable (n=184)ii ORR (%) (95% CI) 60.9 (53.4-68) CR (%)iii 6.0 PR (%)iii 54.9 SD (%)iii 36.4 PD (%) 1.6 CBR (%)iv 76.1 (69.3-82.1) Median DoR (95% CI) 14.8 months (13.8-16.9) Median PFS (95% CI) 16.4 months (12.7-NE) Median OS (95% CI) NE (NE-NE) Estimated OS at 12 months (%) (95% CI) 86 (80-91)  CI, confidence interval; CR, complete response; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease; PD, progressive disease; CBR, clinical benefit rate; NE, not estimable i As assessed by independent central review ii 5.4 mg/kg iii DCR is (CR + PR + SD) is 97.3% (95% CI, 93.8-99.1) iv Responses lasting greater than six months  About HER2 HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein found on the surface of some cancer cells that is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer[1]To be considered HER2 positive, tumor cancer cells are usually tested by one of two methods: immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).

The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date for [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan, an investigational HER2 targeting antibody drug conjugate (ADC), for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer is set for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.  “We are pleased that the FDA has accepted the application and granted Priority Review as we believe [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan has the potential to redefine the treatment of patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer,” said Antoine Yver, MD, MSc, Executive Vice President and Global Head, Oncology Research and Development, Daiichi Sankyo. “Following the recent regulatory submission in Japan, we look forward to working closely with regulatory authorities to bring [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan to patients in the U.S. and Japan as soon as possible.”  “[Fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan has the potential to transform the treatment landscape for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer who have limited treatment options,” said José Baselga, MD, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research & Development Oncology, AstraZeneca. “The priority review draws on the strength and consistency of results seen in phase 1 and phase 2 trials and is an important step on the journey to deliver this potential new medicine to patients.”  [Fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan was previously granted U.S. FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Fast Track designation. The BLA is based on the combination of data from the phase 1 trial published inThe Lancet OncologyOpen new window.,1 and the pivotal phase 2 DESTINY-Breast01 trial. The response rate observed in DESTINY-Breast01, as assessed by an independent review committee, validated the clinical activity observed in the phase 1 trial. Detailed data from DESTINY-Breast01 will be presented at the forthcoming San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December. About HER2HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein found on the surface of some cancer cells that is associated with aggressive disease and poorer prognosis in breast cancer patients.[1]To be considered HER2 positive, tumor cancer cells are usually tested by one of two methods: immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). IHC test results are reported as: 0, IHC 1+, IHC 2+, or IHC 3+.1 A finding of IHC 3+ and/or FISH amplification is considered positive.1  About HER2 Positive Breast CancerApproximately one in five breast cancers are HER2 positive.[2],[3]Despite recent improvements and approvals of new medicines, there remains significant clinical needs for patients with advanced HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.[4],[5]This disease remains incurable with patients eventually progressing after available treatment.4,5 Additionally, there are currently no approved HER2 targeted medicines for HER2 FISH negative, IHC 2+ or IHC 1+ tumors.  About DESTINY-Breast01DESTINY-Breast01 is a pivotal phase 2, open-label, global, multicenter, two-part trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with HER2 positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab emtansine. The primary endpoint of the trial is objective response rate, as determined by independent central review. Secondary objectives include, duration of response, disease control rate, clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Enrollment into DESTINY-Breast01 was completed in September 2018 with 253 patients at more than 100 sites across North America, Europe, Japan and other countries in Asia.  The safety and tolerability profile of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in DESTINY-Breast01 was consistent with the phase 1 trial data published inThe Lancet OncologyOpen new window., in which the most common adverse events (≥30 percent, any grade) included nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, alopecia, fatigue, anemia, diarrhea and constipation. Cases of drug-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, including grade 5 events, have also been reported in the clinical development program.  About [Fam-] Trastuzumab Deruxtecan[Fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201; [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in U.S. only; trastuzumab deruxtecan in other regions of world) is the lead product in the investigational ADC Franchise of the Daiichi Sankyo Cancer Enterprise and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan is comprised of a humanized HER2 antibody attached to a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker. It is designed to target and deliver chemotherapy inside cancer cells and reduce systemic exposure to the cytotoxic payload (or chemotherapy) compared to the way chemotherapy is commonly delivered.  A comprehensive development program is underway in North America, Europe and Asia, including five pivotal trials in HER2 expressing metastatic breast and gastric cancers, including a trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer and low levels of HER2 expression. Phase 2 trials are underway for HER2 expressing advanced colorectal cancer as well as metastatic non-squamous HER2 overexpressing or HER2 mutated non-small cell lung cancer. Trials in combination with other anticancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, also are underway.  Regulatory submission of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan was recently made to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for the treatment of HER2 positive breast cancer. It also has received SAKIGAKE designation for the treatment of advanced HER2 positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW).  [Fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan is an investigational agent that has not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

Many HER2 positive breast cancers eventually advance to the point where no currently approved HER2 targeting medicine continues to control the disease;[3]after treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1, optimal treatment is less clearly defined, and choices may be limited.[4]  About DESTINY-Breast01 DESTINY-Breast01 is a pivotal phase 2, open-label, global, multicenter, two-part trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with HER2 positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with T-DM1. The primary endpoint of the trial is objective response rate. Secondary objectives include duration of response, disease control rate, clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival and overall survival.  The first part of the trial includes a pharmacokinetic stage and a dose-finding stage to identify the recommended dose of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan to be evaluated in the second part of the trial. The second part enrolled patients into one of two cohorts: patients resistant or refractory to T-DM1 (part 2a) and patients who discontinued treatment with T-DM1 for reasons other than resistant or refractory disease (part 2b). Enrollment into DESTINY-Breast01 was completed in September 2018 with 253 patients at more than 100 sites across North America, Europe, Japan and other countries in Asia.  The safety and tolerability profile of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in DESTINY-Breast01 was consistent with therecently publishedOpen new window.phase 1 trial, in which the most common adverse events (≥30 percent, any grade) included nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, alopecia, fatigue, anemia, diarrhea, and constipation. Cases of drug-related pneumonitis, including grade 5 events, have also been reported in the clinical development program.  About [Fam-] Trastuzumab Deruxtecan [Fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201; [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in U.S. only; trastuzumab deruxtecan in other regions of world) is the lead product in the investigational ADC Franchise of the Daiichi Sankyo Cancer Enterprise and the most advanced program in AstraZeneca’s ADC Scientific platform. ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells.  Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC technology, [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan is comprised of a humanized HER2 antibody attached to a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker. It is designed to target and deliver chemotherapy inside cancer cells and reduce systemic exposure to the cytotoxic payload (or chemotherapy) compared to the way chemotherapy is commonly delivered.  A broad and comprehensive development program with [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan is underway in North America, Europe and Asia, including five pivotal trials in HER2 expressing breast and gastric cancers, including in breast cancer patients with HER2 low expression. [Fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan is also in phase 2 development for HER2 expressing advanced colorectal cancer and metastatic non-squamous HER2 overexpressing or HER2 mutated NSCLC, and phase 1 development in combination with nivolumab for HER2 expressing metastatic breast and bladder cancers.  [Fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in 2017 by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive, locally-advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have been treated with trastuzumab and pertuzumab and have disease progression after T-DM1. Fast Track Designation was also granted in the U.S. for the treatment of HER2 positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer in patients who have progressed after prior treatment with HER2 targeted medicines, including T-DM1. Trastuzumab deruxtecan has received SAKIGAKE designation for the treatment of HER2 positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer by the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.  [Fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan is an investigational agent that has not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.  About the Collaboration between Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca In March 2019, Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan as a medicine worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo will maintain exclusive rights.

Over 40 percent of all breast cancers express low levels of HER2 as a cell surface antigen (IHC 2+/ISH- or IHC 1+), but no anti-HER2 therapies are currently approved for these low expressing tumors.[1],[2]In current clinical practice, these patients are classified and treated according to guidelines for HER2 negative breast cancer and according to the hormone receptor (HR) status.2 Many patients eventually progress on current treatments to a point where limited options are available.2 For HER2 negative, HR positive breast cancer, guidelines recommend endocrine therapy plus a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, and, if tumors become resistant, physician’s choice of single-agent chemotherapies is recommended.2 For HER2 negative, HR negative breast cancer (“triple negative\"), treatment is typically with physician’s choice of single-agent chemotherapies.2  “DESTINY-Breast04 has been initiated based on preliminary phase 1 study results to determine whether [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan could serve as a targeted therapy option for patients with HER2 low metastatic breast cancer that progresses after standard chemotherapy, regardless of HR status,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, Vice President, DS-8201 Global Team Leader, Oncology Research and Development, Daiichi Sankyo. “HER2 targeting agents have improved survival rates for HER2 positive breast cancer, but none have been approved in HER2 low expressing tumors. DESTINY-Breast04, our third phase 3 breast cancer trial with [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan, has potential to define a new patient population for HER2 targeted treatment.”  About DESTINY-Breast04 DESTINY-Breast04 is a randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter, two-arm, global phase 3 trial designed to compare the safety and efficacy of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan versus investigator’s choice (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, or nab-paclitaxel) in patients with HER2 low, unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with one to two prior lines of chemotherapy. Patients will be confirmed as low HER2 expression (defined as IHC 2+/ISH- or IHC 1+) through evaluation at a central laboratory.  The primary efficacy endpoint of DESTINY-Breast04 is progression-free survival based on blinded independent central review. Secondary efficacy endpoints include progression-free survival based on investigator assessment, overall survival, objective response rate and duration of response. Safety endpoints include serious adverse events, treatment-emergent adverse events and adverse events of special interest. Health economics and outcomes research endpoints as well as pharmacokinetic and biomarker endpoints will also be measured.  DESTINY-Breast04 will enroll up to 540 patients at approximately 160 sites in regions including, but not limited to, North America, Western Europe, and Asia.

Unmet Need in HER2 Low Expressing Breast Cancer Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the most common cause of cancer mortality among women worldwide.[3]There were approximately 1.67 million new cases of breast cancer diagnosed in 2012.3 Appromixately one in five breast cancers (20 percent) are HER2 positive (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+).[4]HER2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein found on the surface of some cancer cells that is associated with aggressive disease and poorer prognosis.[5],[6]A number of HER2 targeting therapies are approved to treat HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer and have improved survival rates.[7]The remaining 80 percent of breast cancers are classified as HER2 negative; however, over 40 percent still express some level of HER2 as a cell surface antigen and as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC).1 No anti-HER2 agents are indicated for these low expressing tumors, which may be defined as IHC 2+/ISH- or IHC 1+.2  About [Fam-] Trastuzumab Deruxtecan [Fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201; [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in U.S. only; trastuzumab deruxtecan in other regions of world) is the lead product in the investigational ADC Franchise of the Daiichi Sankyo Cancer Enterprise. ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (“payload”) to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary ADC technology, [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan is comprised of a humanized HER2 antibody attached to a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker. It is designed to target and deliver chemotherapy inside cancer cells and reduce systemic exposure to the cytotoxic payload (or chemotherapy) compared to the way chemotherapy is commonly delivered.  A broad and comprehensive development program with [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan is underway in North America, Europe and Asia. In addition toDESTINY-Breast04Open new window., [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan is in phase 3 development versus ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) (DESTINY-Breast03Open new window.) and versus investigator’s choice post T-DM1 (DESTINY-Breast02Open new window.) for HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer; pivotal phase 2 development for HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer resistant or refractory to T-DM1 (DESTINY-Breast01Open new window.); pivotal phase 2 development for HER2 positive advanced gastric cancer resistant or refractory to trastuzumab (DESTINY-Gastric01Open new window.); phase 2 development for HER2 expressing advanced colorectal cancer; phase 2 development for metastatic non-squamous HER2 overexpressing or HER2 mutated NSCLC; and, phase 1 development in combination with nivolumab for HER2 expressing metastatic breast and bladder cancer.  [Fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of patients with HER2 positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have been treated with trastuzumab and pertuzumab and have disease progression after T-DM1, and Fast Track designation for the treatment of HER2 positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer in patients who have progressed after prior treatment with HER2 targeted therapies including T-DM1 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). [Fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan has received SAKIGAKE Designation for the treatment of HER2 positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer by the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW).  [Fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan is an investigational agent that has not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

The updated analysis of 43 evaluable patients with HER2 low expressing metastatic breast cancer (IHC 2+/ISH- or IHC 1+), who received [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan at a recommended expansion dose of 5.4 or 6.4 mg/kg, demonstrated a confirmed overall response rate of 44.2 percent (19/43 patients) and a disease control rate of 79.1 percent (34/43 patients). Preliminary estimate of median duration of response was 9.4 months (range: 1.5+, 23.6+), and median progression-free survival was 7.6 months (95 percent CI: 4.9, 13.7). A total of 54 patients with heavily pretreated (median 7.5 prior anticancer regimens) HER2 low breast cancer have received ≥1 dose [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan 5.4 or 6.4 mg/kg in the study and 23 patients remain on treatment as of data cut-off on October 12, 2018.  “While anti-HER2 therapies play an important role in the treatment of HER2 positive breast cancer, they historically have not demonstrated effectiveness against tumors that express lower levels of HER2,” said Shanu Modi, MD, Breast Medical Oncologist, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and study investigator. “These data offer preliminary evidence of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan activity in HER2 low expressing breast cancers, and based on further study, we are beginning to consider the implications for how we classify and treat these patients.”  A further subgroup analysis of 38 evaluable patients whose disease was also hormone receptor (HR) positive demonstrated a confirmed overall response rate of 47.4 percent (18/38 patients) and a disease control rate of 81.6 percent (31/38 patients) with [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan. Preliminary estimate of median duration of response was 11.0 months (range: 1.5+, 23.6+), and median progression-free survival was 7.9 months (95 percent CI: 4.4, 13.7) in this patient subgroup. A total of 45 patients with HR positive, HER2 low breast cancer have received ≥1 dose [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan 5.4 or 6.4 mg/kg in the study and 21 of these patients remain on treatment as of data cut-off.  “There are no anti-HER2 therapies currently approved for HER2 low expressing breast cancer, which represents about half of all breast cancers,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, Vice President, DS-8201 Global Team Leader, Oncology Research and Development, Daiichi Sankyo. “Based on these data, plans for a phase 3 trial in patients with HER2 low metastatic breast cancer are underway, adding to our broad development program evaluating [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in HER2 expressing breast cancers and other tumor types.“  Updated overall safety data as of October 12, 2018 for all breast cancer patients in the ongoing phase 1 study were also reported at SABCS. Among 170 patients who received at least one dose of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan 5.4 or 6.4 mg/kg for advanced breast cancer in the dose expansion or dose escalation part of the study (regardless of HER2 status), the most common adverse events (≥30 percent, any Grade) included nausea (79.4 percent), decreased appetite (54.1 percent), alopecia (46.5 percent), vomiting (45.9 percent), fatigue (42.4 percent), anemia (40.0 percent), constipation (38.2 percent) and diarrhea (38.2 percent). A total of 50.0 percent of the breast cancer patients experienced a Grade ≥3 adverse event and 22.9 percent had a serious adverse event, including 2.9 percent of patients who experienced an adverse event that lead to death.  ILD Data in Metastatic Breast Cancer Presented An independent committee evaluates any reported cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis in the [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan clinical development program.The first analysis of ILD data, including adjudicated case results, in patients who received [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan for metastatic breast cancer across trials was presented at SABCS 2018 (Poster #P6-17-06).  Among 510 trial patients who received [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan for metastatic breast cancer at one of seven dose levels, there were fifty-four (54) investigator-reported ILD cases of any grade (10.6 percent) including four (4) Grade 5. Thirty-three (33) cases were adjudicated and twenty-eight (28) were considered to be drug-related ILD, including four (4) Grade 5 events.  Among 269 trial patients who received [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan for metastatic breast cancer ata5.4 mg/kg dose, which is the recommended dose for continued development in HER2 positive breast cancer, there were fifteen (15) investigator-reported ILD cases any grade (5.6 percent) including one (1) Grade 5. Seven (7) cases were adjudicated and five (5) were considered to be drug-related ILD, including one (1) Grade 5 event. A third data set was also presented for all patients with advanced solid tumors who received at least one dose of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan across seven ongoing global studies. Among the 665 patients, there were sixty-six (66) investigator-reported ILD cases any grade (9.9 percent) including five (5) Grade 5. Thirty-eight (38) cases were adjudicated and thirty (30) were considered drug-related ILD, including four (4) Grade 5. Of the reported potential ILD cases from all studies, most were mild to moderate in severity, with 80.3 percent (53 of 66) ≤ Grade 2. The median time to onset of ILD was 149 (16–596) days. The study reflects all cases that occurred as of October 15, 2018.  Dose Justification in HER2 Positive Breast Cancer Presented Research establishing 5.4 mg/kg as the recommended dose for continued development of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in advanced HER2 positive breast cancer was presented at SABCS (Poster #P6-17-10). A comprehensive analysis of observed data and exposure-response parameters from the phase 2 DESTINY-Breast01 trial in HER2 positive breast cancer and the ongoing phase 1 trial in multiple types of HER2 expressing tumors was conducted. Efficacy results for a total of 140 patients with HER2 positive breast cancer were included in the exposure-efficacy analysis, and safety results for a total of 276 patients with any tumor type were included in the exposure-safety analysis. Based on the benefit/risk profile, 5.4 mg/kg was chosen as the recommended dose for continued development in HER2 positive breast cancer forDESTINY-Breast01Open new window.and in phase 3 trialsDESTINY-Breast02Open new window.andDESTINY-Breast03Open new window..

Updated efficacy data for 42 evaluable patients who received U3-1402 in dose levels between 1.6 mg/kg to 8.0 mg/kg in the dose escalation and dose finding parts of the study showed a confirmed overall response rate of 42.9 percent (18/42 patients) and a disease control rate of 90.5 percent (38/42 patients) at a median follow-up time of 10.5 months. A median duration of response was not reached (range: 2.8, 13.8+). The median progression-free survival was 8.3 months (range: 1.2, 16.8+). Efficacy was observed in all molecular subtypes. A total of 21 patients remain on treatment at the time of data cut-off on November 6, 2018.  “These results offer preliminary evidence of U3-1402 activity in HER3-positive metastatic breast cancer and further study is warranted,” said Norikazu Masuda, MD, PhD, National Hospital Organization, Osaka National Hospital, Osaka, Japan, and an investigator for the trial. “The initial efficacy and safety data suggest that a HER3-targeting agent such as U3-1402 could provide a new treatment approach for patients with HER3-expressing metastatic breast cancer, who are in need of additional options to manage their disease.”  Updated safety results were also reported. With a median exposure to treatment of 7.6 months, U3-1402 showed a manageable safety profile. The most common adverse events (≥30 percent, any grade) included nausea (85.7 percent), thrombocytopenia (71.4 percent), decreased appetite (66.7 percent), neutropenia (64.3 percent), leukopenia (59.5 percent), vomiting (54.8 percent), AST increased (47.6 percent), ALT increased (45.2 percent), anemia (38.1 percent), stomatitis (35.7 percent) and diarrhea (31.0 percent). The most common adverse events Grade ≥3 (>10 percent of patients) were thrombocytopenia (35.7 percent), neutropenia (28.6 percent), leukopenia (21.4 percent), anemia (16.7 percent) and ALT increased (11.9 percent). Fourteen (14) patients (33.3 percent) experienced serious adverse events regardless of causality, and seven (7) patients (16.7 percent) experienced serious adverse events that were treatment-related. One (1) patient experienced an adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation (2.4 percent), and there were no adverse events leading to death.  “We are encouraged by these preliminary findings with U3-1402, particularly because there are no therapies specifically approved for HER3-expressing breast cancer,” said Kouichi Akahane, PhD, MBA, Executive Officer, Head of Oncology Function, R&D Division, Daiichi Sankyo. “Additionally, these findings continue to build evidence that supports the portability of Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd and linker ADC technology to other targets such as HER3.”  About the Phase 1 Study In this three-part open-label global phase 1/2 study, U3-1402 is given as an intravenous infusion every three weeks. The first part of the study (dose escalation) assessed the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose of U3-1402 in HER3-positive (defined as IHC [immunohistochemistry] 2+/3+) metastatic breast cancer patients who are refractory or intolerant to standard treatment or for whom no standard treatment is available. A maximum tolerated dose has not been reached. Based on preliminary results, dose levels of 4.8 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg are being further evaluated. The second part of the study (dose finding) is assessing the safety and efficacy of U3-1402 and determining the recommended phase 2 dose in HER3-positive metastatic breast cancer patients who have received six or fewer prior chemotherapy regimens. The third part of the study (phase 2) is assessing the safety and efficacy of the recommended dose of U3-1402 in HER3-positive metastatic breast cancer patients who have received six or fewer prior chemotherapy regimens. The study is currently enrolling patients in Japan and the U.S. For more information about this study, please visitClinicalTrials.govOpen new window..  About HER3-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer HER3 is a member of the human epidermal growth factor receptor family of tyrosine kinase receptors, which are associated with aberrant cell growth.¹ HER3 is overexpressed in several types of solid tumors including breast cancer.² HER3 overexpression has been independently associated with a poorer prognosis and reduced survival for patients with invasive breast cancer.¹ A wide range of incidence of HER3 overexpression has been reported in breast cancer, depending on the screening method and published series.¹ There are currently no targeted therapies approved specifically for HER3-expressing breast cancer or any HER3-expressing cancer.  About U3-1402 Part of the investigational ADC Franchise of the Daiichi Sankyo Cancer Enterprise, U3-1402 is an investigational and potential first-in-class HER3-targeting ADC. ADCs are targeted cancer medicines that deliver cytotoxic chemotherapy (\"payload\") to cancer cells via a linker attached to a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific target expressed on cancer cells. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo's proprietary ADC technology, U3-1402 is comprised of a human anti-HER3 antibody attached to a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor payload by a tetrapeptide-based linker. It is designed to target and deliver chemotherapy inside cancer cells and reduce systemic exposure to the cytotoxic payload (or chemotherapy) compared to the way chemotherapy is commonly delivered.  U3-1402 is currently being evaluated in two clinical studies, including the phase 1/2 study for HER3-expressing metastatic or unresectable breast cancer in Japan and the U.S., and a phase 1 study for metastatic or unresectable EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the U.S.  U3-1402 is an investigational agent that has not been approved for any indication in any country.

An updated subgroup analysis in 19 evaluable patients with heavily pretreated HER2 expressing (defined as IHC ≥1+ or amplified) colorectal cancer receiving a recommended expansion dose of 6.4 mg/kg showed that [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan demonstrated a confirmed overall response rate of 15.8 percent (3 of 19 patients) and a disease control rate of 84.2 percent (16 of 19 patients). Median duration of response has not been reached andmedian progression-free survival was 3.9 months (95 percent CI: 2.1, 8.3) for this subgroup of patients.These patients had tumors with varying degrees of HER2 expression based on central IHC assessment of archival tissue, including six patients with HER2 IHC of zero (0). Tumor shrinkage primarily was observed in tumors with higher levels of HER2 IHC.  “We are encouraged by these preliminary results with [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan, particularly given the unmet medical need for patients with HER2 expressing colorectal cancer that has progressed on one or more prior therapies,” said Takayuki Yoshino, MD, PhD, Director of Gastroenterology and Gastrointestinal Oncology at National Cancer Center Hospital East, Kashiwa, Japan, a study investigator. “These initial findings support further evaluation of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in this specific type of colorectal cancer.”  “There are no therapies specifically approved for patients with HER2 expressing colorectal cancer, and continued study of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan will provide a better understanding of the potential role of a HER2 targeting antibody drug conjugate in these patients,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, Vice President, DS-8201 Global Team Leader, Oncology Research and Development, Daiichi Sankyo. “Patient enrollment is underway into our global phase 2 study evaluating safety and efficacy of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with HER2 expressing advanced colorectal cancer.”  Updated overall safety data as of August 10, 2018 across all subgroups of the ongoing phase 1 study with [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in various HER2 expressing cancers were also reported at ESMO.Among 259 patients who received at least one dose of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan 5.4 or 6.4 mg/kg in Part 1 or Part 2 of the study (regardless of tumor type), the most common adverse events (≥30 percent, any Grade) included nausea (74.1 percent), decreased appetite (56.8 percent;) vomiting (43.6 percent), anemia (37.8 percent), alopecia (37.5 percent), fatigue (34.0 percent), diarrhea (33.6 percent) and constipation (32.8 percent). A total of 54.1 percent of patients experienced a ≥ Grade 3 adverse event and 22.8 percent had a serious adverse event, including 4.6 percent of patients who experienced an adverse event that led to death.As previously presented, five cases of Grade 5 interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis were reported by the investigators for the overall population of the phase 1 study, none of which was observed in patients with colorectal cancer. Any reported cases of ILD/pneumonitis in the [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan clinical development program are evaluated by an independent adjudication committee.  Unmet Need in Colorectal Cancer Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide. In 2012, there were approximately 1.36 million new cases diagnosed and 690,000 deaths worldwide.1Approximately 25 percent of patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis, meaning the disease has spread to distant organs, and about 50 percent of patients with colorectal cancer will eventually develop metastases.2Prognosis for these patients remains poor.3  An increase in the number of approved targeted therapies for advanced colorectal cancer over the past decade has helped improve outcomes for some patients, however efficacy and tolerability of second and third-line treatments remain limited.4,5,6,7,8Approximately 3 percent of colorectal cancers overexpress the HER2 protein, which is a well-established therapeutic target in breast and gastric cancer.4In addition, research indicates that HER2 amplification may be associated with resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy and shorter survival.9,10Currently, no approved HER2 targeting therapies exist for patients with colorectal cancer.  About the [Fam-]Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Phase 1 Study An open-label, two-part phase 1 study is currently evaluating [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with advanced/unresectable or metastatic solid tumors that are refractory or intolerant to standard treatment, or for whom no standard treatment is available. The primary objective of the dose escalation phase of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan and determine the maximum tolerated dose. Data from this part of the study were published in theLancet Oncology.11  In the dose expansion part of the phase 1 study, [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan is given in one of two doses (5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg) to patients with HER2 positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer and gastric cancer, HER2 low expressing breast cancer and other HER2 expressing solid tumors including colorectal cancer. Overall, 292 patients have been enrolled into this phase 1 study of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan. For more information about the study, visitClinicalTrials.govOpen new window..

DESTINY-Breast03 will be a head-to-head comparison of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan versus ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), also a HER2 targeting ADC, while DESTINY-Breast02 will assess [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients previously treated with standard of care HER2 therapies including T-DM1.  Current treatment guidelines for patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer recommend the combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab and a taxane as first-line therapy.1,2For patients whose cancer progresses after initial treatment, T-DM1 is an anti-HER2 agent specifically approved for second-line therapy.1For cancers that progress after HER2 targeted agents trastuzumab, pertuzumab and T-DM1, there is no specific standard of care. Options for these patients are standard chemotherapy with or without continued anti-HER2 therapy and consideration of palliative care.1  “The DESTINY-Breast03 trial is a key element of our comprehensive development strategy to determine the potential of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan as a second-line therapy in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer,” said Gilles Gallant, BPharm, PhD, Vice President, DS-8201 Global Team Leader, Oncology Research and Development, Daiichi Sankyo. “DESTINY-Breast03 will also help assess whether our investigational and proprietary ADC linker and payload technology used in [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan demonstrates clinical relevance when compared to another HER2 targeting ADC currently approved in this setting.”  Enrollment into DESTINY-Breast01, the pivotal phase 2 trial evaluating [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in HER2 positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer resistant or refractory to T-DM1 was completed in September 2018, with approximately 230 patients at more than 100 sites in North America, Europe, Japan and other countries in Asia.  About DESTINY-Breast03 DESTINY-Breast03 is a randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter, two-arm, global phase 3 trial designed to compare the safety and efficacy of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan versus T-DM1 in patients with HER2 positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane.  The primary efficacy endpoint of DESTINY-Breast03 is progression-free survival based on blinded independent central review. Secondary efficacy endpoints include overall survival, objective response rate, duration of response, clinical benefit rate and progression-free survival based on investigator assessment. Safety endpoints include serious adverse events, treatment-emergent adverse events and adverse events of special interest. Exploratory efficacy endpoints include duration of stable disease and time to response. Health economics and outcomes research endpoints as well as pharmacokinetic and biomarker endpoints will also be measured.  DESTINY-Breast03 will enroll approximately 500 patients at 150 study sites in North America, Asia and Europe. For more information about the study, visitClinicalTrials.govOpen new window..  About DESTINY-Breast02 DESTINY-Breast02 is a randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter, two-arm, global phase 3 trial designed to compare the safety and efficacy of [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan versus investigator’s choice (trastuzumab plus capecitabine or lapatinib plus capecitabine) in patients with HER2 positive unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with standard of care HER2 therapies including T-DM1.

For more information about this study, visitClinicalTrials.govOpen new window..  Unmet Need in HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer Breast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide, responsible for approximately 1.67 million of 14.1 million new cases of cancer diagnosed each year.4Despite improving survival rates over the past 25 years, breast cancer was the fifth leading cause of cancer death overall and was the number one cause of cancer death in women in 2012.3,4For patients diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, five-year survival rates are low.5  About one in five breast cancers overexpress HER2, a tyrosine kinase receptor growth-promoting protein found on the surface of some cancer cells, which is associated with aggressive disease.4Several unmet needs remain today in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer. Many tumors advance to the point where no currently approved HER2 targeting treatment continues to control the disease, and there is no current standard of care for HER2 positive tumors after treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab and T-DM1.1,6  About [Fam-] Trastuzumab Deruxtecan [Fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201; [fam-] trastuzumab deruxtecan in U.S. only; trastuzumab deruxtecan in other regions of world) is the lead product in the investigational ADC Franchise of the Daiichi Sankyo Cancer Enterprise.
